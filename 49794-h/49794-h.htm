<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>My Dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p class='c005'>To experience the approbation of the
public in general must ever be gratifying to the
author of any literary work, however humble
may be its subject: such has been my fortunate
lot as to the first two volumes of these light
sketches of incident and character.</p>

<p class='c004'>But when my attempt also received the unqualified
approbation of one of the most able,
learned, and discriminating official personages
that England has, or probably will have to boast
of, my vanity was justly converted into pride,
and a value stamped upon my production which
I durst not previously have looked to.</p>

<p class='c004'>Greatly indeed was my pleasure enhanced
when your Lordship informed me that my
<span class='pageno' title='iv' id='Page_iv'></span>Sketches had “given me much repute here, were
read with <i>general avidity</i>, and considered as giving
much insight into the original character of the
Irish.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet a still stronger testimonial of your Lordship’s
favour was reserved to augment my pride
and pleasure—your Lordship’s note to me, stating,
that my volumes “had afforded him much
amusement, and had given very general satisfaction;
and that he was tempted to wish for a
third volume composed of similar materials.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Your wish, my Lord, is obeyed. A third volume
is composed, and if it should have the good fortune
to afford your Lordship an hour’s amusement,
my gratification will be consummated.</p>

<p class='c004'>After more than threescore and ten winters
have passed over the head of man, any increase
of mental faculty, or intellectual powers in a
writer can never be expected; at the very best
he may be stationary. I can, therefore, only
offer you this volume, such as it is: receive it,
then, my Lord, as the last and only <i>souvenir</i> I
can now tender to mark the sincerity, respect,
and attachment, with which I am your Lordship’s
faithful servant,</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The Introduction prefixed to the first volume
of these Sketches somewhat developes the origin
of the work, and the source of its materials.
Commenced to wear away the tedium of a protracted
winter, it continued, for nearly three
months, the amusement of my leisure hours.
During that short space the entire of the two
first volumes was collected and composed.</p>

<p class='c004'>I do not allude to this as any proof of literary
expertness: on the contrary, I offer it as some
apology for the inaccuracies incidental to so
hasty a performance. In common with all biographical
and anecdotical compositions, mine cannot
affect to be exempt from small errors; but
whatever they may be, I alone am responsible.
Not one anecdote—character—sentence—observation—line—or
even thought, was contributed or
<span class='pageno' title='vi' id='Page_vi'></span>suggested to me by any living person; nor was a
single page of the MS. even seen by any friend
save one (and that but very partially), on whose
suggestion it had been commenced, and on whose
recommendation I transmitted the two first
volumes to my present publisher, but with (I
own) very great diffidence as to their catastrophe.
On that point, however, I was most agreeably
disappointed. The flattering excitement which
originated the present volume appears in the
dedication.</p>

<p class='c004'>In deference to the <i>goût</i> of the present fashionable
class of readers, I deeply regret that these
volumes are not the florid children of fiction and of
fancy. Unfortunately, they are only embellished
recitals of actual facts and incidents, extracted
from authentic sources, and forming an <i>Olla Podrida</i>
of variegated materials—some, perhaps, too cheerful
for the grave—others too <i>sombre</i> for the cheerful,
and, on the whole, I fear, rather too <i>ordinaire</i>
for refinement, or insufficiently <i>languid</i> for modern
sensibility—particularly of the softer sex,
whose favour, of all things, I should wish to
cultivate.</p>

<p class='c004'>I cannot deny also my presumption in having
garnished these Sketches here and there with my
<span class='pageno' title='vii' id='Page_vii'></span>own crude or digressive observations; but my
<i>ensemble</i> being altogether a whimsical composition,
without sequence or connexion, minor errors may
merge in the general confusion, and the originator
of them be screened under the gabardine of his
singularity.</p>

<p class='c004'>The only merit which I actually claim is, that
the principal sketches somewhat illustrate the
native Irish character at <i>different epochas</i> in different
grades of society, and furnish some amusing
points of comparison between the more <i>remote</i>
and the <i>modern</i> manners and habits of that eccentric
people;—and there my irregularities are perfectly
appropriate. But a far more dangerous
ordeal lies glowing hot before me;—I fear my
fair readers will never pardon me for introducing
so small a proportion of true love into my anecdotes—an
omission for which I am bound, so far
as in me lies, to give the very best apology I can.
But when I reflect on the exquisite tenderness of
the female heart, and its intrinsic propensity to
imbibe that most delicious of the passions on
every proper opportunity, I almost despair of
being able to conciliate the lovely spinsters who
may deign to peruse my lucubrations; and if the
ladies of an <i>age mûr</i> do not take my part, I shall
be a ruined author. Trembling, therefore, I proceed
<span class='pageno' title='viii' id='Page_viii'></span>to state some matters of fact, which, if dispassionately
considered and weighed, may prove
that, from the rapid movements of love in Ireland,
there can be but very scant materials for interesting
episodes in that country.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ireland has been ever celebrated by every
author who characterised it, as the most amatory
of islands; and the disinterestedness of its lovers,
and their inveterate contempt of obstacles, and
abhorrence of any species of procrastination, has
been a subject of general eulogium.</p>

<p class='c004'>Love is the only object of liberty and equality
as yet enjoyed by the Irish people. Even among
the better orders, <i>money</i>, not being in general there
the circulating medium of matrimony, is always
despised when it does not attend, and abused
behind its back as inveterately as if it was a
sub-sheriff.</p>

<p class='c004'>A love-stricken couple seldom lose their precious
moments practising idle sensibilities, and waiting
for bank-notes that won’t come, or parchments
that have not one word of truth in them. Such
illusory proceedings were very sensibly dispensed
with, and a justifiable impatience generally, because
quite natural, sent formality about its business.
The lovers themselves came to the real point;
a simple question and categorical reply settled the
<span class='pageno' title='ix' id='Page_ix'></span><i>concours</i> at once; and marriage and possession
occupied not unfrequently the second or third
evening after a first acquaintance, whilst the first
of a honey-moon, and the commencement of a new
family, dated sometimes from the first evening of
acquaintance. After that knot was tied, they
always had an indefinite time and unrestrained
opportunities to cultivate their love, or what remained
of it, for the remainder of their existence.</p>

<p class='c004'>This rapid, but rational consummation of love-matches
in Ireland, however, left no opportunity
or field for amatory adventures, as in countries
where love, jealousy, and murder are often seen
bubbling in the same cauldron!</p>

<p class='c004'>No doubt the Irish manner of courtship plunders
love of its episodes, romance of its refinements,
and consequently my fair English readers of those
sentimentalities which so beautifully garnish the
produce of imagination-workers. Take it all for
all, however, Irish love is found to answer very
well for domestic purposes, and, making allowances
for wear and tear, to be, I believe, to the
full, as durable as in any other country.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a plainer way, I now frankly confess that
during the composition of the three volumes, my
<i>inventive</i> genius, (if I have any,) like one of the
<span class='pageno' title='x' id='Page_x'></span>seven sleepers, lay dormant in my <i>occiput</i>, and
so torpid, that not one fanciful anecdote or brilliant
hyperbole awakened during the whole of
that ordinary period; and I fear that there is
not an incident in the whole which has any just
chance of melting down my fair sensitives into
that delicious trickle of pearly tears, so gratifying
to the novel writers, or even into one soft sigh of
sympathetic feeling, so naturally excited by exploits
in aerial castles, or the embroidered scenery
of fancy and imagination.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of the egotistical tone of these volumes I am
also most gravely accused. The best reply I can
make, (and it seems rather a decisive one,) is,
that it would be a task somewhat difficult for the
wisest author that ever put pen to paper, to
separate egotism from autobiography; indeed, I
believe it has never yet been practically attempted.
Were I to leave myself out of three
volumes of my own <i>personal</i> anecdotes, I rather
think I should be consigned to Miss Edgeworth for
the destiny of increasing her volume of Irish
Blunderers. I fancy also that with most ladies
and gentlemen in these civilized parts of this
terrestrial globe, the <i>amour propre</i> (<i>alias</i> <i>egotism</i>)
holds a very considerable rank amongst their
<span class='pageno' title='xi' id='Page_xi'></span>intellectual gallantries; and, as in <i>garçon</i> Cupid’s
amours, it would be no easy matter for either
sex to enforce profound silence on the matter of
their adoration; and I apprehend the singular
number will hardly be turned out of service in
the English grammar to gratify my commentators
by making me write nonsense.</p>

<p class='c004'>These observations are addressed to my good-humoured
and playful critics; but there is another
class of a very different description. I have
been honoured by the animadversions of as many
of these sharp-set gentry as any uncelebrated
author could possibly expect, or indeed any
reasonable writer could possibly wish for; and,
though the comparison may be considered as out
of course, I shall nevertheless add it to the rest of
my <i>errata</i>, and compare my orchestra of cavillers
to the performers in a Dutch concert, where
every musician plays his own tune, and no two
of their airs or instruments are in harmony.</p>

<p class='c004'>Literary works may be fairly termed literary
chopping-blocks; like the human species, they
never fail to have plenty of snarlers to cut up the
reputation of the author, and probably the very
best parts of his production. However, it is consolatory
to perceive that many of those ingenious
<span class='pageno' title='xii' id='Page_xii'></span>gentry who have done me that honour may with
convenience and economy pluck their <i>own wings</i>
to make their pens of; and I am satisfied that if
the Roman gander who saved the Capitol were
permitted to return to earth, and visit the metropolis
of England, he would feel infinite gratification
at finding that so many of his family have
been raised to the rank of critics, and are now
flourishing amongst the human species.</p>

<p class='c004'>By some of my most inveterate cavillers I
have been accused of personality. Never was an
imputation worse founded. I feel incapable of
leaning on any fair or worthy person. But it is
impossible for any biographical writer to avoid
topics of general allusion, which the equivocal
good-nature of <i>intimate friends</i> seldom fails to find
out an appropriate application for. Should the
proprietors of shallow egotism or arrogant folly,
however, (and such things <i>are</i>,) please to fit caps
on their own heads, and look at general allusion
through a microscope, I do not feel myself bound
either to undeceive or confirm their applications—the
<i>qui capit ille facit</i> is their own act, not my
aphorism.</p>

<p class='c004'>In truth, the multiplicity of inaccuracies, fibs,
bounces, and impossibilities imputed to me are
<span class='pageno' title='xiii' id='Page_xiii'></span>of so many families and ranks, that I scarcely
know how to arrange their table of precedence;
but as all manner of things connected with theology,
from the days of Jupiter Ammon to Pope
Joan, and thence to our own episcopacy, take
place of temporal concerns, so I rather think I
should adopt the same course of procedure; and
therefore, as the doctrine of spirits and ghosts is
incontestably connected with theological dogmas,
so I conceive it most decorous to begin with that
very supernatural subject.</p>

<p class='c004'>The article as to Lord Rossmore’s Bansheen,
(in the first volume,) has been the favourite subject
of general animadversion, incredulity, and
inveterate impeachment of my orthodoxy, common
sense, religion, and morality. Yet, strange to
say, I absolutely persist unequivocally as to the
matters therein recited, and shall do so to the day
of my death, after which event I shall be able to
ascertain individually the matter of fact to a
downright certainty, though I fear I shall be
enjoined to absolute secrecy.</p>

<p class='c004'>To give new food to my cavillers, I now reassert
what has been already read with expressed
surprise at my heterodoxy—namely, that
no man or woman, old or young, <i>professing</i> Christianity,
<span class='pageno' title='xiv' id='Page_xiv'></span>and yet denying the possible appearance
of apparitions in the world, can be a genuine, or
indeed any Christian at all; nay, not even an
unadulterated Deist, and most certainly not a
member of the Jewish persuasion, as this can be
<i>his</i> only argument. Nor shall I omit in my following
challenge every member of the 104 sects
that have, like suckers, sprouted out of and
weakened the established Church of England,
(which, I think, might, after reforming the clergy,
have served people very well, without the assistance
of any hair-splitters, unless they were
unconscionable epicures in theology); to all such
folks I here throw down my glove—and by these
presents, I invite any preacher, teacher, priest,
bishop, deacon, fat dignitary, or lank curate, who
disclaims my said doctrine, to reply to it if he
can—otherwise I shall crow over him, reasonably
considering that “silence gives consent,”
and set down my doctrines as admitted fully and
unanimously by the <i>nil dicits</i> of all the Christian
clericals and pious labourers in the holy vineyards,
and all the singers at the Meeting Houses
in the British Empire.</p>

<p class='c004'>Consistently with my rank as a goblin <i>chaperone</i>,
I should consider myself guilty of great
<span class='pageno' title='xv' id='Page_xv'></span>impoliteness did I not notice one or two of the
lectures I have received from lay disputants since
the two first volumes have been published, but
which other occupations have heretofore prevented
me from duly noticing.</p>

<p class='c004'>The most formidable, because the most rational,
of my avowed contraventionists, has attacked me
on a point which I admit to be the most assailable
of my anecdotes, and to constitute the most
plausible ground he could pitch his scepticism
on: I allude to his dogma as to my Rossmore
Bansheen, in which he asserts that all supernaturals
are now-a-days as much out of fashion and as
scarce as miracles. I admit that miracles, <i>eo nomine</i>,
have diminished very considerably (without any
good reason that I know of) for some centuries past,
and consequently, that my assertion of modern
supernaturals has, in the opinion of many wise
persons, lost the advantage of that scriptural confirmation,
which it certainly would have had eighteen
hundred years ago. But that is only begging the
question without the candour of admitting that
if miracles <i>ever</i> existed, the same Omnipotence
which created may <i>revive</i> them, particularly as all
these matters are decided in a world that not a
priest in Europe has any communication with.
<span class='pageno' title='xvi' id='Page_xvi'></span>Prejudices—whether natural or transplanted—have
long roots: they shoot deep and strong,
and are most difficult to eradicate. Out of a hundred
pertinacious argumentators, I verily believe
there is seldom even one of the debaters, who at
the conclusion admits a single <i>scintilla</i> of diminution
in his original hypothesis. So prone is
man to prejudice, that I have known clerical
rhetoricians argue, on points of their own trade,
very <i>nearly</i> that black was white; and I really
believe all the Saints in the calendar could not
make any impression on their sentiments; therefore,
yielding all argument deducible either from
the Witch of Endor, or the Weird Sisters, &amp;c., I
found my tenet upon proven facts and causes, of
which the (assailed) anecdote of Lord Rossmore
is only as a vanguard.</p>

<p class='c004'>This plausible and ingenious antagonist, to whom
I allude, is a gentleman universally considered to
be in his sound senses, and of high respectability;
and one who, I believe, both individually and professionally,
generally <i>looks</i> before he <i>leaps</i>: this
gentleman has so billeted his scepticism on his
brain, that it lives at free quarters, and shuts its
door against all reasoning; and I much fear his
incredulity will retain its post, till he becomes a
<span class='pageno' title='xvii' id='Page_xvii'></span>goblin himself, and learns the fallacy of his prejudices
by actual demonstration.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some other intolerant correspondents, of much
personal consideration, are fully entitled to my
proper observation; and I regret that, a preface
being inappropriate to any controversy in detail,
I am obliged to postpone paying my <i>devoirs</i> to
them. But this above-named gentleman having
favoured me with a letter of many pages, expressing
his unqualified disbelief of Lord Rossmore’s
Bansheen and all ghosts in general, and
his extreme <i>surprise</i> that I could venture to support
so exploded a doctrine, I should act unhandsomely
if I did not acknowledge the receipt
of it, and assure him that I shall take the earliest
opportunity I can of putting in my rejoinder.</p>

<p class='c004'>I admit that the reasoning of this respectable
intolerant (Mr. T—— of Gray’s Inn) appeared
so moral, rational, religious, pious, and plausible,
that even an idiot, or a soft country gentleman
with a blank mind, might, without any further imputation
against his understanding, be actually
convinced by it. However, as I do not boast of
these latter qualities, I retain my own doctrine inflexibly,—and
so does Mr. T——; and lamentable
it is to say, that there is not the most remote
<span class='pageno' title='xviii' id='Page_xviii'></span>probability of either of us yielding his hypothesis,
or any human possibility of finding any person in
the whole world who could decide as an arbitrator.
Mr. T—— conceives that I cannot be a
Christian if I believe in supernaturals, and I am
as steadily convinced that he cannot be a true
Christian if he does not. The majority of society,
who seldom take the trouble of looking deeper
than the surface in matters of theology, except
when they are text-puzzled on Sundays, are
mostly on his side; profound philosophers, theoretical
moralists, and all delicate ladies, are on
mine. However, there being no mathematical demonstration
on either, well authenticated supernaturals
are the sole mode of deciding the question
in this part of the firmament. On this enigmatical
subject my good friends the clergy are
rather awkwardly circumstanced. They may be
very excellent casuists, so far as their knowledge
<i>extends</i>; yet, being only simple mortals themselves,
they can know no more about the matter
than the most ignorant of their parishioners.
Though my Lords Spiritual, the Bishops of
England, are by far the most temporal, sleek, and
comfortable covey of prelates on the surface of
this globe—whatever they may do in their political
<span class='pageno' title='xix' id='Page_xix'></span>capacities, it would be profane to suppose
they could have private audiences either in the
upper or lower department of the other world,
<i>until</i> their <i>post obitums</i> fall in, and give them
the <i>entrée</i>. The fattest prelate of the land, therefore,
can know no more of supernaturals than
the hungriest curate of his diocese; the happy
translation, however, must take place, (and nobody
can tell how soon,) and no doubt its approach
must be hailed by these parties with great pleasure,
as the only tranquil catastrophe they can be
absolutely certain of during this ticklish epoch.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have already mentioned that my reasoning on
this subject in detail appears in the first volume
of this work; where, though I profess no enthusiastic
adoration of Dr. Johnson’s morality, I
certainly am proud to have the advantage of his
coincidence on the subject of supernaturals. I
therefore refer my respectable antagonist, Mr.
T——, (whom, by-the-by, I never had the honour
of speaking to or seeing,) to that volume.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have also received, amongst many other favours
upon the same subject, a letter under the
signature of R. H., Brompton; but, though on
thick gilt paper, of a very different complexion,
and in very different language from that of my
<span class='pageno' title='xx' id='Page_xx'></span>last-named correspondent. Mr. R. H. accuses me
of publishing <i>absolute falsehoods</i>, and putting <i>dangerous</i>
doctrines into the heads of <i>silly people</i>,
which he illustrates by the example of his <i>own
wife and daughter</i>, who, “naturally nervous,” ever
since reading my argument in favour of ghosts,
&amp;c., fall into “twitters” if they hear any noise
in the house after nightfall, which they cannot
instantly account for. His life is a torment to him!
Even a kitten, which was locked up accidentally
in a cupboard, and began to rattle the tea-things
after the candles were put out, threw Mrs. H.
into strong hysterics, and nearly cost Miss H.
her reason, besides the expense of drugs and
attendance. This Mr. H., of Brompton, describes
himself “a <i>rational</i> gentleman,” (<i>credat Judæus
Apelles!</i>) I suppose in contradistinction to me; but,
whether gentle or simple, he has in his commentary
on my anecdote been so far impartial, that he has
shown no greater respect for his own composition
than he has for mine. To do him justice, he has
not attempted reasoning: therein he was perfectly
right; reason does not seem to be his forte, or in
unison with either his temper or intellect, and the
<i>retort courteous</i> with which he has favoured me is
vastly better adapted to both the manners and
<span class='pageno' title='xxi' id='Page_xxi'></span>capacity of that gentlemanly personage. To increase
his troubles, I have referred him to a
decided ghost story ycleped the “Tapestry
Chamber,” from the celebrated pen of Sir Walter
Scott, directing my letter “dead office, Brompton.”
That story was vouched by Miss Seward,
the most learned and religious of the <i>bas-bleus</i>.
It has been swallowed by the public at large with
a greedy avidity, as a genuine undoubted apparition;
nor has a single reviewer, commentator,
periodical, or other species of critic, ever ventured
to call it a <i>bounce</i>, or to express the slightest
doubt of its absolute authenticity. Whilst Sir
Jonah Barrington’s “Bansheen of Lord Rossmore,”
vouched by three living persons, has
experienced all manner of ugly epithets, the
“Tapestry Chamber,” so vouched, remains in full
blow, with scarcely an unbeliever. It is observable
also that Sir Walter’s apparition, coming a
year after my “Bansheen,” and the public strictures
thereupon, proves and exemplifies his coincidence
in my belief; and (Miss Seward having
been for some time a ghost herself) I trust Sir
Walter, not being defunct, will, on his return from
his travels, do me the justice of confirming my
tenet by his own, and the authority of Miss
<span class='pageno' title='xxii' id='Page_xxii'></span>Seward. In the mean time, as for Mr. R. H.
of Brompton, whom I <i>strongly suspect</i> to be an
M.P. and a saint—<i>requiescat in pace!</i> unless I
can trace the writing, and, if I can, he may be
assured the public shall have a garnished edition
of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Irish mower cutting his <i>own</i> head off has
also afforded a multiplicity of amusing comments,
both from my friends and the periodicals; the
former call it <i>ingenious</i>, the latter a <i>bounce</i>. However,
I refer my sceptics to the second edition of
the former portion of these Sketches, where that
incident is repeated and enlarged upon. That
anecdote, not being in any degree <i>supernatural</i>,
is susceptible of testimony; and it is rather fortunate
for me that the very same respectable
gentleman, Mr. T., who is so inflexible an anti-Bansheen,
was also an avowed disbeliever of my
self-decapitation anecdote, until his friend, Lord
Mountnorris, <i>vouched</i> to him decidedly the <i>truth</i>
of Dennis’s cutting his own <i>head</i> off, though his
lordship would not give him the same corroboration
as to the <i>ear</i> of his comrade: however, as to
that, <i>exceptio probat regulam</i>, and I am contented.</p>

<p class='c004'>So numerous have been the comments I have
read in print, and received in MS., as to different
<span class='pageno' title='xxiii' id='Page_xxiii'></span>articles of those Sketches, that a rejoinder to
one half of them would be more than food for
a tolerable quarto, and of course my notices must
be very limited.</p>

<p class='c004'>The letter which I received, marked <i>private</i>, by
post from London, under the signature Z. Y.,
though long in my possession, I had no clue to
answer, or any <i>à-propos</i> opportunity of noticing;
and I regret that the limits of a Preface do not
even now admit me to go much further than to
advert to the subject of it. That subject, could
I here dilate on it, would afford myself a very
agreeable field for general as well as individual
comment; and indeed, not being devoid of a
popular interest, it deserves a distinct, and not
limited consideration: such (I intend) it shall
receive hereafter on a different occasion. At present
I only wish the persons therein alluded to,
and particularly the one who, Z. Y. insinuates,
“has felt <i>no pleasure</i> at my observations,” to be
assured that I should consider myself much to
blame, had I intended to draw any <i>invidious comparisons</i>,
or lean either by irony, ridicule, or satire,
on either of two persons so justly and highly
estimated by the public, for whom I feel the
sentiments of private friendship, and whom I
<span class='pageno' title='xxiv' id='Page_xxiv'></span>have known before they could either know or
forget themselves.</p>

<p class='c004'>One observation, however, I may venture, and
(though singular) I have very generally found it
a true one, namely, that the best writers are the
most thin-skinned, and become jealous of comment,
<i>pari passu</i> with the march of their celebrity.
Even when their literary reputation has
been popularly established beyond the power of
“reviewing” injury, they feel more ticklish at criticism
than scribblers in the fifth degree of comparison;
and, as if they were afflicted with the
disease called “noli me tangere,” they consider
even the approach of a quill as injurious to their
tranquillity. Such species of impression on
either a party or a partizan has no doubt procured
me the honour of the letter I have alluded
to;—it is palpably the work of no ordinary penman.
I regret that I must persist in my opinion
both as to the lady and gentleman, and cannot
relinquish my consistency as to the principle of
distinction between genius and talent, though
with modification, and perhaps according to <i>my</i>
more minute <i>view</i> of these modern rarities.</p>

<p class='c004'>I never found these gifts of intellect completely
amalgamated in any one modern writer either in
<span class='pageno' title='xxv' id='Page_xxv'></span>prose or poetry. Heavens and earth—flights of
fancy, and matters of fact, <i>savans</i> and rainbows,
angels, and ladies of quality, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. afford
very different touchstones whereby to assay the
extent of human intellect.</p>

<p class='c004'>The personages that Z. Y. has alluded to may
rest assured that not a friend of theirs, either old
or new, has a greater pride in their compatriotship
than the composer of this terrestrial bagatelle;
the one works in prose, and dresses in
poetry, the other makes Irish petticoats with foreign
flounces to them. Both are good artists—yet
I confess myself so very worldly and unrefined a
being that I should, under the circumstances of
Ireland, prefer one sound, unexaggerated, unagitating
true matter-of-<i>fact</i> essay on the real condition
of my countrymen. The most lovely
subjects of madrigal and sonnet, after a curt
exhibition of their charms, wax old and ugly,
and in some time enjoy little more than a florid
epitaph. Time with his extinguisher soon puts out
all flames of an amatory description, and reduces
both the poet and his muse—the first (if he lives)
to a state of dotage, the other to the enjoyment of
some “newer lover.” But the love of a country
blooms for ever: it defies the power of time and
<span class='pageno' title='xxvi' id='Page_xxvi'></span>the lapse of ages; and I should like to see the
produce of some proud and emulative talent or
genius, to decide which is best adapted to descant
upon that subject. Two attempts on that
matter I have seen; the one has lost reputation
by danger—diving too deep; the other gained
none by being too superficial. Of all themes,
<i>absenteeism</i>, if handled strongly, would give great
credit, if its writer would take a fair, clear, and
comprehensive view of that existing cause of
national misfortune.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>PERPLEXITIES OF A BARONET.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Author apologises for ending, instead of commencing, his former volumes, with an inquiry into his pedigree—How to improve a family name—The cognomen of Alderman Sir W. Stammer—Vowel <i>versus</i> Consonant—The lady of “masculine understanding”—The Alderman’s conditions on altering his surname—Unsuspected presidency of <i>King James</i> at the Dublin municipal meetings—Ulster king-at-arms—George the Fourth’s visit to Dublin—Various heraldic bearings.</p>

<p class='c006'>The concluding the second volume of my Biographical
Sketches with the recital of a laborious
search after my progenitors, doubtless savours
somewhat of our national perversions. But those
who know the way in which things are done in
Ireland, will only call it a “doughan dourish,”
or “parting drop”—which was usually administered
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>when a man was not very sure which end
of him was uppermost.</p>

<p class='c004'>The English, in general, though not very exquisite
philologists, and denominated “Bulls” in
every known part of the world, have yet a great
aversion to be considered “<i>blunderers</i>;” an <i>honour</i>
which their own misprisions of speech fall short
of, owing to the absence of point in their humour
(as they call it).</p>

<p class='c004'>When an English dramatist wants a <i>good blunder</i>,
he must send to Ireland for it. A few <i>English</i>
blunders would damn the best play; and I
have known some pieces actually saved by a profusion
of Irish ones. As to my misplacing my pedigree,
I can only say, that though an English
writer, speaking of his origin, would say he was
born and bred at London, &amp;c. &amp;c.—an Irishman
always places his acquirements before his
birth, and says he was bred and born at Drogheda,
&amp;c. My mistake is not quite so bad as this; and I
shall endeavour to recompense my readers for
having made it, by transporting them to the city
of Dublin, where, so long as a thing has <i>fun in it</i>,
we set all cold-blooded critico-cynicals at defiance,
and where we never have a lack of families and
of good pedigrees—at least for home consumption.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sketch which I thus introduce has certainly
nothing whatever in it connected with myself.
However, it is so far in point, that it proves
how very differently gentlemen may furbish up
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>families;—one by traversing foreign parts to discover
the old cavaliers, arms, and quarterings of
his race;—another by garnishing a new coach
with new quarters, shields, and bearings, such as
no family, ancient or modern, had ever seen or
heard of till they appeared emblazoning the pannels
of an alderman’s landau.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the year of our Lord 1809, after his late Majesty
King George the Third had expended forty-nine
years of his life in ruling the state, it pleased
his royal fancy to order a universal jubilee, and to
elevate his Lord Mayors into Imperial Baronets.
At this propitious era, William Stammer, Esquire,
Alderman of Dublin, and likewise of Skinners’
Alley, wine-merchant, do. consumer, dealer and
chapman, freemason, orangeman, and friendly
brother, happened, by Divine Providence and
the good-will of the Common Council, to be seated
on the civic throne as “the Right Honourable the
Lord Mayor of the King’s good city of Dublin.”
He ruled with convivial sway the ancient, loyal,
joyous, moist, and vociferous municipal corps of
the said celebrated city, and its twenty-four federated
corporations:—consequently he was, in
point of dignity, the second <i>Lord Mayor</i> in all
<i>Christendom</i>, though unfortunately born a few centuries
too late to be one of its seven <i>champions</i>.
However, being thus enthroned at that happy
festival time, he became greater than any of
these, and found himself, suddenly, as if by magic,
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>(though it was only by patent,) metamorphosed
into <i>Sir</i> William Stammer, Baronet of the United
Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir William Stammer, Bart., being (as he himself
often informed me, and which I believe to be
true,) an excellent, good-hearted kind of person,
and having by nature an even, smooth-trotting
temper, with plenty of peace and quietness in it,
bore his rank with laudable moderation: but as
he was the first genuine corporator the Union had
honoured by this <i>imperial</i> dignity, he felt a sort of
loyal fervor, which urged him to make some particular
acknowledgment to his gracious Majesty
for so unprecedented a mark of distinction. But
in what way a sober British king should be complimented
by an Irish wine-merchant was a matter
which required much ingenuity and profound
consideration. At length, it was suggested and
strongly urged by several of his civic friends,
(especially those of the feminine gender,) that his
Lordship had it actually within his power to pay
as loyal and handsome a compliment as ever was
paid to any king of England by an Irish gentleman
with a twang to his surname; <i>videlicet</i>, by
sacrificing the old Irish pronunciation thereof,
ameliorating the sound, and changing it in such
sort, that it might be adapted to the court language,
and uttered without any difficulty or grimace
by the prettiest mouths of the highest classes
of British society; it was, in fact, strenuously
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>argued that, instead of the old hacknied family
name commonly pronounced Stam-mer, the word
<i>Steem-er</i> (being better vowelled and Anglicised)
would sound far more genteel and modern, and
ring more gratefully in the ear of royalty. It was
also urged, how Mrs. Clarke’s friend, the Rev.
Dr. O’Meara, unfortunately lost the honour of
preaching before royalty by his pertinacity in retaining
the abominable <i>O</i>, and that had he dropped
that hideous prefixture, and been announced
plainly as the Rev. Doctor Meera, his doctrines
might probably have atoned for his Milesianality,
and a stall in some cathedral, or at least a rural
deanery, might have rewarded his powers of declamation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Having begun so well, who knows what famous
end you may arrive at, Sir William?” said Sir
Jemmy Riddle, the then high sheriff (a very
good man too), who was be-knighted on the same
occasion. “When we all go to St. James’s,” continued
Sir Jemmy, “to thank our Sovereign and
kiss his hand in <i>his own metrolopus</i>, sure the name
of our Lord Mayor, Sir W. Steemer, will sound
every taste as harmonious if not <i>harmoniouser</i>,
than that of the great Sir Claudius Hunter, or our
own Claudius Beresford, or any Claudius in Europe!—and
sure, changing <i>am</i> for <i>ee</i>, to please
his Majesty, is neither a sin nor a shame in any
family, were they as old as <i>Mathuslin</i>:—besides,
old White, the schoolmaster, the greatest scholar,
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>by odds, that ever was in Dublin, told me that
one vowel was worth two consonants any day in
the year; and that the alteration would make a
great difference in the sweetness of the odes he
was writing on your promotion.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir William, however, being fond of the old
proper name which had stuck to him through
thick and thin, in all weathers, and which he
and his blood relations had been so long accustomed
to spell, did not at all relish the proposed
innovation. Besides, he considered that any thing
like the assumption of a new name might bring
him too much on a level with some <i>modern</i> corporators,
who not having any particular cognomen of
their own at the time of their nativity, or at least
not being able to discover it, but being well
christened for fear of accidents, very judiciously
took only provisional denominations for their apprenticeship
indentures, and postponed the adoption
of any immutable surname until they had considered
what might probably be most attractive to
customers in their several trades.</p>

<p class='c004'>The grand measure was nevertheless so strongly
pressed—the ladies so coaxed the alderman to
take the <i>pretty</i> name, and they were so well supported
by Sir Charles Vernon, then master of the
ceremonies, (and of course the best judge in Ireland
of what was good for Sir William at the Castle
of Dublin,) that his resolution gradually softened,
wavered, and gave way. He became convinced
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>against his will, and at last, with a deep
sigh and a couple of imprecations, ungratefully
yielded up his old, broad, national <i>Stammer</i>, to
adopt an Anglicised mincemeat version thereof;
and in a few nights, Sir William <i>Steemer’s</i> landau
was announced as stopping the way at the breaking
up of the Duchess of Richmond’s drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c004'>’Tis true, some very cogent and plausible reasons
were suggested to Sir William, pending the
negotiation, by a lady of excellent judgment, and
what was termed in Dublin “masculine understanding.”
This lady had great weight with his
lordship. “You know, my Lord Mayor,” said
she, sententiously, “you are now nine or ten
pegs (at the lowest computation) higher than you
were as a common alderman, and a pronunciation
that might sound quite in unison with ‘sheriff’s
peer,’ would be mere discord in the politer mouths
of your new equals.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah! what would Jekey Poole say to all this,
if he were alive?” <i>thought</i> Sir William, but was
silent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Consider, also,”—pursued the lady,—“consider
that Stammer is a very common kind of word; nay,
it is a mere verb of Dutch extraction (as that great
man Doctor Johnson says), which signifies stuttering;
and to articulate which, there is a graceless
double chopping of the under jaw—as if a person
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>was taking a bite out of something:—try now, try,
Stammer—Stammer!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Egad, it’s—it’s very true,” said Sir William:
“I—I never remarked that before.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But,” resumed the lady with the masculine
understanding, “the word Steemer, on the contrary,
has a soft, bland, liquid sound, perfectly
adapted to genteel table-talk. To pronounce
Steemer, you will perceive, Sir William, there is a
slight tendency to a lisp: the tip of the tongue
presses gently against the upper gums, and a nice
extension of the lips approaching toward a smile,
gives an agreeable sensation, as well as a polite
complacency of countenance to the addresser.—Now,
try!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir William lisped and capitulated—on express
condition; first, that the old County Clare tone
of Stammer, in its natural length and breadth,
should be preserved when the name was used by
or to the Corporation of Dublin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Granted,” said the lady with the masculine
understanding.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Secondly, amongst the aldermen of Skinners’
Alley.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Granted.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thirdly, in the Court of Conscience.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Granted.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fourthly, in my own counting-house.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Granted—according to the rank of the visitor.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>“Fifthly, as to all my <i>country</i> acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Granted, with the exception of such as hold
any offices, or get into good company.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The articles were arranged, and the treaty took
effect that very evening.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir William no doubt acquired one distinction
hereby, which he never foresaw. Several other
aldermen of Dublin city have been since converted
into baronets of the United Kingdom, but not one
of them has been able to alter a single syllable in
his name, or to make it sound even a semitone
more <i>genteel</i> than when it belonged to a commonplace
alderman. There was no lack of jesting,
however, on those occasions. A city punster, I
think it was a gentleman called, by the Common
Council, Gobbio, waggishly said, “That the Corporation
of Dublin must be a set of incorrigible
Tories, inasmuch as they never have a feast without
<i>King-James</i><a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> being placed at the head of their
table.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two Dublin aldermen lately made baronets; one by his
Majesty on his landing in Ireland (Alderman King); and the
other by the Marquess of Wellesley on <i>his</i> debarkation (Alderman
James), being the first public functionary he met. The
Marquess would fain have <i>knighted</i> him; but being taken by
surprise, he conferred the same honour which Aldermen Stammer
and King had previously received.</p>

<p class='c004'>There are now four baronets amongst that hard-going corporation.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>It is said that this joke was first cracked at the
Castle of Dublin by a gentleman of the long robe,
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>and that Mr. Gobbio gave one of the footmen
(who attended and <i>took notes</i>) half a guinea for it.
Though a digression, I cannot avoid observing that
I hear, from good authority, there are yet some
few wits surviving in Dublin; and it is whispered
that the butlers and footmen in genteel families
(<i>vails</i> having been mostly abolished since the
Union) pick up, by way of substitute, much ready
money by taking notes of the “<i>good things</i>” they
hear said by the lawyers at their masters’ dinner
parties, and selling them to aldermen, candidates
for the sheriffry, and city humourists, wherewith
to embellish their conversation and occasionally
their speeches. Puns are said to sell the best,
they being more handy to a corporator, who has
no great vocabulary of his own: puns are of easy
comprehension; one word brings on another, and
answers for two meanings, like killing two birds
with one stone, and they seem much more natural
to the memory of a common councilman than wit
or any thing classical—which Alderman Jekey
Poole used to swear was only the d—’d <i>garbage</i>
(gibberish) of schoolmasters.</p>

<p class='c004'>Had the Jubilee concern ended here, all would
have been smooth and square:—but as events in
families seldom come alone, Providence had decreed
a still more severe trial for Sir William
<i>Steemer</i>—because one of a more important character,
and requiring a more prompt as well as expensive
decision.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>Soon after the luxurious celebration of the
Jubilee throughout the three united kingdoms
(except among such of the Irish as happened to
have nothing in their houses to eat or drink, let
their loyalty be ever so greedy), I chanced to call
at the Mansion House on official business; and
Sir William, always hospitable and good-natured,
insisted on my staying to taste (in a family way)
some “<i>glorious turtle</i>” he had just got over from
the London Tavern, and a bottle of what he called
“old Lafitte with the red nightcap,” which, he
said, he had been long preserving wherewith to
<i>suckle</i> his Excellency the Duke of Richmond.</p>

<p class='c004'>I accepted his invitation: we had most excellent
cheer, and were busily employed in praising
the vintage of 1790, when a sealed packet, like a
government dispatch, was brought in by the baronet’s
old porter. We all thought it was something
of consequence, when Sir William, impatiently
breaking the seal, out started a very beautiful
painting on parchment or vellum, gilded and garnished
with ultramarine, carmine, lapis caliminaris,
and all the most costly colours.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Heyday!” said Sir William, staring: “what
the deuce have we here? Hollo! Christopher—Kit—I
say Kit—who—who—or where the devil
did this come from?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By my sowl, my lord,” replied Christopher,
“I dunnough who that same man was that fetched
it; but he was neat an’ clean, and had good apparel
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>on his body, though it was not a livery like
mine, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did—did—he say nothing, Kit?” said Sir
William, surprised.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh yes, plenty my lord; he desired me on
my peril to give the thing safe and sound to your
lordship’s own self. He swore, like any trooper,
that it was as good as a ten thousand pound bank
of Ireland note in your pocket any how. So I
curdled up at that word, my lord; I towld him
plain and plump he need not talk about peril to
me; that I was nothing else but an honest sarvant;
and if the said thing was worth <i>fifty</i> pounds
in <i>ready money</i> it would be as safe as a diamond
stone with me, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And was that all, Christopher?” said Sir William.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh no, my lord,” replied Kit, “the man
grinned at me all as one as a monkey; and said
that, maybe, I’d be a master myself one of these
days. ‘By my sowl, maybe so, Sir,’ says I,
‘many a worse man arrived at being an attorney
since I came into service;’ and at the word, my
lord, the said man held his hand quite natural, as if
he’d fain get something into it for his trouble; but
the devil a cross I had in my fob, my lord, so I
turned my fob inside out to show I was no liar,
and he bowed very civilly and went out of the
street-door, laughing that the whole street could
hear him; though I could swear by all the books in
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>your lordship’s office, that he had nothing to laugh
at: and that’s all I had act or part in it, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir William now seemed a little puzzled, desired
Christopher to be gone, and throwing the painting
on the table, said, “I didn’t want any arms or
crests. I had very good ones of my own, and I
don’t understand this matter at all. My family
had plenty of arms and crests since King William
came over the water.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So have mine—a very nice lion rampant of
their own, my lord,” said her ladyship, as excellent
a woman as could be: “I’m of the Rawins’s,”
continued she, “and they have put me into your
arms, Sir William:—look!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh that is all as it should be, my dear,” said
his lordship, who was a very tender husband. But
regarding it more closely, her ladyship’s colour,
as she looked over his shoulder, mantled a few
shades higher than its natural roseate hue, and
she seemed obviously discontented.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I tell you, Sir William,” said she, “it is a
malicious insult; and if you were out of the
mayoralty, or my boy, Lovelace Steemer, had arrived
at full maturity, I have no doubt the person
who sent this would be made a proper example
of. I hope you feel it, Sir William.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Feel!—feel what, my love?” said Sir William,
calmly, he being not only a courteous, but a
most peaceful citizen. “Don’t be precipitate, my
darling!—let us see—let us see.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>“See!” said her ladyship, still more hurt, “ay,
see with your own eyes!” pointing to the <i>insult</i>:
“the fellow that painted that (whoever he is) has
placed a pair of enormous horns just over your
head, Sir William!—a gross insult, Sir William—to
me, Sir William—indeed to both of us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I was much amused, and could not help observing
“that the horns were certainly enormous
horns, to be sure; but as the joke must be intended
against Sir William himself—not her ladyship—I
hope—” said I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, no, Sir Jonah,” said the lady interrupting
me.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see now,” said Sir William, looking at the
bottom, “this comes from Ulster.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Read on, Sir William,” said I, “read on.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ay, Ulster king-at-arms: and who the deuce
is <i>Ulster king-at-arms</i>?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose,” said I, “some blood relation to
the Escheator of Munster, and—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And who—who the d—l is the <i>Escheator of
Munster</i>?” said Sir William (who had never vacated
a seat in the Irish Parliament).</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is of the same family as the Chiltern hundreds,”
quoth I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Chiltern hundreds! Chiltern hundreds! By
Jove, they must be an odd family altogether,”
said the Lord Mayor, still more puzzled, his lady
sitting quite silent, being now altogether out of
her depth,—till a small letter, to that moment overlooked,
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>was taken up and read by the Lord Mayor,
and was found to be connected with a bill furnished,
and wanting nothing but a receipt in full to
make it perfect. The countenance of Sir William
now became less placid. It proved to be a very
proper and fair intimation from his Majesty’s herald-at-arms,
to the effect that, as the baronetcy
originated with the Jubilee, and was granted in
honour of King George the Third having ruled
half a century, an amplification of the new baronet’s
heraldry by an additional horn, motto, ribbon,
&amp;c., was only a just tribute to his Majesty’s longevity!
and, in truth, so properly and professionally
was the case stated, that Ulster’s clear opinion may
be inferred that every family in the empire might,
in honour and loyalty, take a pair of horns, motto,
and ribbon, as well as Sir William, if they thought
proper so to do, and on the same terms.</p>

<p class='c004'>How the matter was finally arranged, I know
not; but the arms came out well emblazoned and
duly surmounted by a more moderate and comely
pair of horns; and Sir William, in regular season,
retired from office with due <i>éclat</i>, and in all points
vastly bettered by his year of government.
Though he retired, like Cincinnatus—but not to
the plough—Sir William reassumed his less arduous
duties of committing rogues to Newgate—long
corks to Chateau Margaux—light loaves to the
four Marshalsea Courts—and pronouncing thirteen-penny
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>decrees in the Court of Conscience:<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
every one of which occupations he performed correctly
and zealously, to the entire satisfaction of
the nobility, clergy, gentry, and public at large,
in the metropolis of Ireland.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Every lord mayor of Dublin becomes judge of a “Court
of Conscience” for twelve months after the expiration of his
mayoralty; each decree costing a shilling; many of the causes
are of the most comical description; but never would there have
arisen so great a judge as Sancho Panza of Barataria, from
presiding in our Court of Conscience.</p>

<p class='c004'>I cannot omit stating, that Sir William, when lord mayor,
gave the most numerous, brilliant, and complete masquerade
ever seen in Dublin, or, I believe, any where else. There were
fourteen or fifteen hundred persons, and I am sure not more
than one hundred dominoes; every body went in character, and
every person tried to keep up the character he adopted. Ireland,
of all places in the world, is, perhaps, best adapted to a
masquerade, as every Irishman is highly amused when he can
get an opportunity of assuming, by way of freak, any new character.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was the custom for the mob, on those occasions, to stop
every carriage, and demand of each person, “What’s your
character?” I was dreadfully tired of them in the street on
the night in question; but fairly put into good-humour by the
<i>jeu d’esprit</i> of a mob-man, who opened the carriage-door.
After I had satisfied him as to character, he desired to know,
where I was going? “Shut the door,” said I. “Ah, but
where are you going?” I was vexed. “I’m going to the
<i>Devil</i>,” said I. “Ough, then, <i>God</i> send you safe!” replied the
blackguard.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>An incident appertaining to the same body, but
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>with a termination by no means similar, occurred
a few years afterward, which, among other matters,
contributes to show what different sort of things
the Irish at different times rejoice in. In 1809,
they rejoiced in full jubilee on the memorable
event of his Majesty King George the Third having
entered the fiftieth year of his reign, without
ever paying one visit to, or taking the least notice
of, his loyal Corporation of Dublin: and after he
was dead (<i>de facto</i>, for the King never dies <i>de jure</i>),
they celebrated another jubilee on account of his
Majesty George the Fourth honouring them with
a visit <i>the very earliest opportunity</i>. This was the
first time any king of England had come to Ireland,
except to cut the throats of its inhabitants; and his
present Majesty having most graciously crossed over
to sow peace and tranquillity among them, if possible,
and to do them any and every kindness which
they would <i>submit to</i>, it was not wonderful each
man in Ireland hailed the event as forming a most
auspicious commencement of his Majesty’s reign,
not only over his subjects at large, but, in particular,
over that glorious, pious, immortal, and uproarious
body, the Corporation of Dublin city.
Events have proved how ungratefully his Majesty’s
beneficent intentions have been requited.</p>

<p class='c004'>His Majesty having arrived at the hill of Howth,
to the universal joy of the Irish people, was received
with unexampled cordiality, and in due
form, by the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor,
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>on the very field of battle where O’Brien Borun
had formerly acquired undying fame by cutting
the Danes into slices (an operation which we
have since repeated on them at Copenhagen,
though with different instruments). That Right
Honourable Lord Mayor was Sir Abraham Bradley
King, then one of the best looking aldermen in
Europe. On this occasion he obtained, not military
honour, but, on the other hand, a more tranquil
one than the said King O’Brien Borun ever arrived
at;—he was actually <i>imperialised</i> as a baronet in
very superior style to his brother corporator
<i>Steemer</i>, on the loyal demi-century occasion.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have since heard that an effort was made
somewhat to transform the armorial bearings of
the Bradley King family, also, in commemoration
of this auspicious event; and that it was intended
to give him, as an addition to his crest, Sir John
Skinner’s steam packet, out of which his Majesty
had landed just previous to bestowing the baronetcy
on Sir Abraham. Here the city punsters
began again with their vulgar insinuations; and,
omitting the word <i>packet</i>, gave out that Alderman
King wanted to put Alderman <i>Steemer</i> as a supporter
to his arms, instead of a griffin rampant or
unicorn, as customary on these occasions; but
this vile play upon words Sir Abraham peremptorily
and properly checked with the same constitutional
firmness and success wherewith he had
previously refused to “tell tales out of school”
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>about the Orangemen to the House of Commons.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This was the first instance I recollect of pertinacity conquering
privilege.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>On this occasion, Sir Abraham proudly and virtuously
declared that all the heralds in Europe
should never <i>ravish</i> him as they had done his brother
Steemer; and that if any alteration was to be
made in his shield by Ulster-at-arms, or any
Ulster in Europe, he would permit nothing but
an emblematic crown to be introduced therein, in
honour and commemoration of his sovereign; and
though our national poet, Mr. Thomas Moore, and
Sir Abraham, never coalesced upon any point
whatsoever (except the consumption of paper), yet
on this conciliatory occasion, Sir Abraham declared
his willingness to forgive and forget the religion
and politics of the poet for eight and forty
hours. This was as it should be; and a crown,
with a posy or nosegay in its neighbourhood (instead
of a cut and thrust) are accordingly embodied
in the armorial bearings of Sir Abraham, the
cruel idea of a bloody hand being now softened
down and qualified by the bouquet which adorns
it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the indefatigable corporation wags, who
could let nothing pass, began their jocularities:
the worthy Baronet’s name being <i>King</i>, and the
shield having a <i>crown</i> in it, the Common Council
began to hob-nob him as, <i>Your Majesty</i>, or the
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span><i>Crown Prince</i>, or such like. But Sir Abraham
had been an officer in the King’s service, and
being a spirited fellow to boot, he declared open
and personal hostility against all low and evil-minded
corporate punsters. These <i>titles</i> were
therefore relinquished; and the whole affair
ended, to the real satisfaction of every staunch
Protestant patriot from Bray to Balbiggen, and as
far westward as the College of Maynooth, where
I understand the rejoicings terminated—for Sir
Abraham found the road <i>too bad</i> to travel any farther.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having endeavoured somewhat to divert the
reader’s criticism on my pedigree blunder, I have,
in compliance with the wish of one of the ablest,
wisest, and steadiest public personages of Great
Britain (whose title heads this volume), reopened
my old trunks, and made a further attempt at
amusing myself and other folks—and at depicting,
by authentic anecdotes, the various and extraordinary
habits and propensities of the Irish people,
with their gradual changes of national character
for the last fifty or sixty years,—which (to my
grief I say it) will be the work, not of a <i>novelist</i>,
but a <i>contemporary</i>. I fancy there are very few of
those who flourished so long ago, who could procure
pen, ink, and paper, either for love or money,
where they sojourn at present; and of those who
still inhabit the same world with the stationers,
some have lost one half of their faculties, at least,
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>and scarce any among the remainder possess sufficient
energy to retrace by description the events
that took place during a long and, perhaps, active
career. I shall take Time by the forelock; and,
ere the candle goes out, draw as many Sketches
of my past day as I may have time to record, before
I wish the present generation a good morning—which
adieu cannot now be long distant:—<i>tant

  <span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>DANGERS OF REFLECTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Personal description of Counsellor Conaghty—Singular contrast of physical roughness and mental suavity—A legal costume—The Counsellor’s marriage—The bride described—Her plan for inducing her husband to sacrifice to the Graces—The fatal mirror—The Counsellor views himself in a new light—His consternation and false persuasion—The devil unjustly accused—Conaghty’s illness and death.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most extraordinary instance I recollect
of a sudden affection of the mind being fatal
to the body was presented by an old acquaintance
of mine, Counsellor Conaghty, a gentleman
of the Irish bar, who pined and died in consequence
of an unexpected view of his own person;
but by no means upon the same principle as Narcissus.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Conaghty was a barrister of about six feet
two inches in length; his breadth was about three
feet across the shoulders; his hands splay, with
arms in full proportion to the rest of his members.
He possessed, indeed, a set of limbs that would
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>not have disgraced a sucking elephant; and his
body appeared slit up two-thirds of its length, as
if Nature had originally intended (which is not
very improbable) to have made twins of him—but
finding his <i>brains</i> would not answer for <i>two</i>, relinquished
her design. His complexion, not a disagreeable
fawn-colour, was spotted by two good
black eyes, well intrenched in his head, and
guarded by a thick <i>chevaux de frise</i> of curly eyebrows.
His mouth, which did not certainly extend,
like a john-dory’s, from ear to ear, was yet
of sufficient width to disclose between thirty and
forty long, strong, whitish tusks, the various
heights and distances whereof gave a pleasing
variety to that feature. Though his <i>tall</i> countenance
was terminated by a chin which might,
upon a pinch, have had an interview with his
stomach, still there was quite enough of him between
the chin and waistband to admit space for
a waistcoat, without the least difficulty.</p>

<p class='c004'>Conaghty, in point of disposition, was a quiet,
well-tempered, and, I believe, totally irreproachable
person. He was not unacquainted with the
superficies of law, nor was he without professional
business. Nobody, in fact, disliked him, and he
disliked nobody. In national idiom, and Emerald
brogue, he unquestionably excelled (save
one) all his contemporaries. Dialogues sometimes
occurred in Court between him and Lord
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>Avonmore, the Chief Baron, which were truly
ludicrous.</p>

<p class='c004'>The most unfortunate thing, however, about
poor Conaghty, was his utter contempt for what
fastidious folks call <i>dress</i>.—As he scorned both garters
and suspenders, his stockings and small-clothes
enjoyed the full blessings of liberty. A well-twisted
cravat, as if it feared to be mistaken for a
cord, kept a most respectful distance from his honest
throat—upon which the neighbouring beard
flourished in full crops, to fill up the interstice.
His rusty black coat, well trimmed with peeping
button-moulds, left him, altogether, one of the
most tremendous figures I ever saw, of his own
profession.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length it pleased the Counsellor, or old Nick
on his behalf, to look out for a wife; and, as
dreams go by contraries, so Conaghty’s perverse
vision of matrimonial happiness induced him to
select a <i>sposa</i> very excellent internally, but in her
exterior as much the reverse of himself as any two
of the same species could be.</p>

<p class='c004'>Madam Conaghty was (and I dare say still is) a
neat, pretty, dressy little person: her head reached
nearly up to her spouse’s hip; and if he had
stood wide, to let her pass, she might (without
much stooping) have walked under him as through
a triumphal arch.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was quite delighted with his captivating
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>fairy, and she equally so with her good-natured
giant. Nothing could promise better for twenty
or thirty years of honey-moons, when an extraordinary
and most unexpected fatality demonstrated
the uncertainty of all sublunary enjoyments, and
might teach ladies who have lost their beauty the
dangers of a looking-glass.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Counsellor had taken a small house, and
desired his dear little Mary to furnish it to her
own dear little taste. This, as new-married ladies
usually do, she set about with the greatest zeal
and assiduity. She had a proper taste for things
in general, and was besides extremely anxious
to make her giant somewhat smarter; and, as
he had seldom in his life had any intercourse
with looking-glasses larger than necessary just
to reflect his chin whilst shaving, she determined
to place a grand <i>mirror</i> in her little drawing-room,
extensive enough to exhibit the Counsellor
to himself from head to foot—and which, by reflecting
his loose, shabby habiliments, and tremendous
contour, might induce him to trim himself
up.</p>

<p class='c004'>This plan was extremely promising in the eyes
of little Mary; and she had no doubt it would be
entirely consonant with her husband’s own desire
of Mrs. Conaghty’s little drawing-room being the
nicest in the neighbourhood. She accordingly
purchased, in Great George Street, at a very
large price, a looking-glass of sufficing dimensions,
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>and it was a far larger one than the Counsellor had
ever before noticed.</p>

<p class='c004'>When this fatal reflector was brought home, it
was placed leaning against the wall in the still
unfurnished drawing-room,—and the lady, having
determined at once to surprise and reform her
dear giant, did not tell him of the circumstance.
The ill-fated Counsellor, wandering about his new
house—as people often do toward the close of the
evening—that interregnum between sun, moon,
and candlelight, when shadows are deep and figures
seem lengthened—suddenly entered the
room where the glass was deposited. Unconscious
of the presence of the immense reflector, he beheld,
in the gloom, a monstrous and frightful Caliban—wild,
loose, and shaggy,—standing close and direct
before him; and, as he raised his own gigantic
arms in a paroxysm of involuntary horror, the
goblin exactly followed his example, lifting its
tremendous fists, as if with a fixed determination
to fell the Counsellor, and extinguish him for ever.</p>

<p class='c004'>Conaghty’s imagination was excited to its utmost
pitch. Though the spectre appeared larger
than any d—l on authentic record, he had no
doubt it was a genuine demon sent express to destroy
his happiness and carry him to Belzebub.
As his apprehensions augmented, his pores sent
out their icy perspiration: he tottered—the fiend
too was in motion! his hair bristled up, as it were
like pikes to defend his head. At length his blood
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>recoiled, his eyes grew dim, his pulse ceased, his
long limbs quivered—failed; and down came poor
Conaghty with a loud shriek and a tremendous
crash. His beloved bride, running up alarmed by
the noise, found the Counsellor as inanimate as
the boards he lay on. A surgeon was sent for,
and phlebotomy was resorted to as for <i>apoplexy</i>,
which the seizure was pronounced to be. His
head was shaved; and by the time he revived a
little, he had three extensive blisters and a cataplasm
preparing their stings for him.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was two days before he recovered sufficiently
to tell his Mary of the horrid spectre that had assailed
him—for he really thought he had been
felled to the ground by a blow from the goblin.
Nothing, indeed, could ever persuade him to the
contrary, and he grew quite delirious.</p>

<p class='c004'>His reason returned slowly and scantily; and
when assured it was only a <i>looking-glass</i> that was
the cause of his terror, the assurance did not alter
his belief. He pertinaciously maintained, that this
was only a kind story invented to tranquillise him.
“Oh, my dearest Mary!” said poor Conaghty,
“I’m gone!—my day is come—I’m called away
for ever. Oh! had you seen the frightful figure
that struck me down, you could not have survived
it one hour! Yet why should I fear the
d—l? I’m not wicked, Mary! No, I’m not <i>very</i>
wicked!”</p>

<p class='c004'>A thorough Irish servant, an old fellow whom
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>the Counsellor had brought from Connaught, and
who <i>of course</i> was well acquainted with supernatural
appearances, and had not himself seen the
fatal mirror,—discovered, as he thought, the real
cause of the goblin’s visit, which he communicated
to his mistress with great solemnity, as she
afterward related.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mistress,” said the faithful Dennis Brophy,
“Mistress, it was all a <i>mistake</i>. By all the books
in the master’s study, I’d swear it was only a
mistake!—What harm did ever my master do
nobody? and what would bring a d—l overhauling
a Counsellor that did no harm? What say could
he have to my master?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t teaze me, Dennis,” said the unhappy
Mary; “go along!—go!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll tell you, mistress,” said he; “it was a
d—l sure enough that was in it!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hush! nonsense!” said his mistress.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By J—s! it <i>was</i> the d—l, or one of his gossoons,”
persisted Dennis; “but he mistook the
house, mistress, and that’s the truth of it!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean?” said <i>the mistress</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, I mane that you know Mr. —— lives
on one side of us, and Mr. —— lives at the other
side, and they are both <i>attornies</i>, and the people
say they’ll both go to <i>him</i>: and so the d—l, or his
gossoon, mistook the door, and you see he went off
again when he found it was my master that was
<i>in it</i>, and not an attorney, mistress.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>All efforts to convince Conaghty he was mistaken
were vain. The illusion could not be removed
from his mind; he had received a shock
which affected his whole frame; a constipation of
the intestines took place; and in three weeks, the
poor fellow manifested the effects of groundless
horror in a way which every one regretted.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>FORMER STATE OF MEDICINE IN IRELAND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Remarks on Sir Charles Morgan’s account of the Former State of Medicine in Italy—The author’s studies in the Anatomical Theatre of Dublin University—Dr. Burdet—Former importance of farriers and colloughs—Jug Coyle, and her powers of soliloquy—Larry Butler, the family farrier, described—Luminous and veritable account of the ancient colloughs—The <i>faculty</i> of the present day—Hoynhymms and Yahoos—Hydrophobia in Ireland, and its method of cure.</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Sir Charles Morgan has given us,
at the conclusion of his lady’s excellent work
“Italy,” the state of “medicine” in that country.
Our old cookery books, in like manner, after
exquisite receipts for all kinds of dainties, to suit
every appetite, generally finished a luxurious volume
with <i>remedies</i> for the “bite of a mad dog—for
scald heads—ague—burns—St. Anthony’s fire—St.
Vitus’s dance—the tooth-ache,” &amp;c. &amp;c. Now,
though the Doctor certainly did not take the
cooks by way of precedent, that is no reason why
I should not indulge my whim by citing both examples,
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>and garnishing this volume with “the
state of medicine in Ireland” fifty years ago.</p>

<p class='c004'>I do not, however, mean to depreciate the state
of medicine in these days of “new lights” and
novelties, when old drugs and poisons are <i>nicknamed</i>,
and every recipe is a rebus to an old
apothecary. Each son of Galen now strikes out
his own system; composes his own syllabus; and
<i>finishes</i> his patients according to his own proper
fancy. When a man dies after a consultation
(which is generally the case—the thing being
often decided by <i>experiment</i>)—there is no particular
necessity for any explanation to widows,
legatees, or heirs-at-law; the death alone of any
testator being a sufficient apology to his nearest
and dearest relatives for the failure of a consultation—that
is, if the patient left sufficient property
behind him.</p>

<p class='c004'>My state of Irish medicine, therefore, relates to
those “once on a time” days, when sons lamented
their fathers,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and wives could weep over
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>expiring husbands; when every root and branch of
an ancient family became as black as rooks for the
death of a blood relation, though of almost incalculable
removal. In those times the medical old
woman and the surgeon-farrier—the bone-setter
and the bleeder—were by no means considered
contemptible practitioners among the Christian
population—who, in common with the dumb
beasts, experienced the advantages of their miscellaneous
practice.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In these times it may not, perhaps, be fully credited when
I tell—that four of my father’s sons carried his body <i>themselves</i>
to the grave: that his eldest son was in a state bordering on
actual distraction at his death; and in the enthusiastic paroxysms
of affection which we all felt for our beloved parent at that cruel
separation, I do even now firmly believe there was not one of
us who would not, on the impulse of the moment, have sprung
into, and supplanted him in his grave, to have restored him to
animation. But we were all a family of nature and of heart,
and decided enemies to worldly objects.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>An anatomical theatre being appended to the
University of Dublin, whenever I heard of a <i>fresh</i>
subject, or remarkable corpse, being obtained for
dissection, I frequently attended the lectures, and
many were the beauteous women and fine young
fellows then carved into scraps and joints <i>pro bono
publico</i>.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a> I thereby obtained a smattering of information
respecting our corporeal clockwork;
and having, for amusement, skimmed over “Cullen’s
First Lines,” “Every Man his Own Doctor,”
“Bishop Berkeley on Tar Water,” and “Sawny
Cunningham on the Virtues of Fasting Spittle,” I
almost fancied myself qualified for a diploma. A
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>Welsh aunt of mine, also, having married Doctor
Burdet, who had been surgeon of the Wasp sloop
of war, and remarkable for leaving the best
stumps of any naval practitioner, he explained to
me the use of his various instruments for tapping,
trepanning, raising the shoulder-blades, &amp;c. &amp;c.:
but when I had been a short time at my father’s
in the country, I found that the farriers and old
women performed, either on man or beast, twenty
cures for one achieved by the doctors and apothecaries.
I had great amusement in conversing with
these people, and perceived some reason in their
arguments.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I never saw a young woman brought into the dissecting-room
but my blood ran cold, and I was immediately set a-moralising.
The old song of “Death and the Lady” is a
better lecture for the fair sex than all the sermons that ever were
preached, including Mr. Fordyce’s. ’Tis a pity that song is
not <i>melodised</i> for the use of the fashionables during their campaigns
in London.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>As to the farriers, I reflected, that as man is
only a mechanical animal, and a horse one of the
same description, there was no reason why a drug
that was good for a pampered gelding might not
also be good for the hard-goer mounted on him. In
truth, I have seen instances where, in point both
of intellect and endurance, there was but very
little distinction between the animals—save that
the beverage of the one was <i>water</i>, and that of
the other was <i>punch</i>—and, in point of <i>quantity</i>, there
was no great difference between them in this matter
either.</p>

<p class='c004'>At that time there was seldom more than one
regular doctor in a circuit of twenty miles, and a
farrier never came to physic a gentleman’s horse
that some boxes of pills were not deducted from
his balls, for the general use of the ladies and
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>gentlemen of the family; and usually succeeded
vastly better than those of the apothecary.</p>

<p class='c004'>The class of old women called colloughs were
then held in the highest estimation, as understanding
the cure (that is if God pleased) of all
disorders. Their <i>materia medica</i> did not consist of
gums, resins, minerals, and hot iron,—as the farriers’
did; but of leaves of bushes, bark of trees,
<i>weeds</i> from <i>churchyards</i>, and mushrooms from
<i>fairy grounds</i>; rue, garlic, rosemary, birds’-nests,
foxglove, &amp;c.: in desperate cases they sometimes
found it advisable to put a <i>charm</i> into the bolus or
stoop, and then it was sure to be “firm and
good.” I never could find out what either of their
charms were. They said they should die themselves
if they disclosed them to any body. No
collough ever could be a <i>doctor</i> whilst she had one
tooth remaining in her head, as the remedy was
always reduced to a pulp or paste by her own
mumbling of its materials, and the contact of an
old grinder would destroy the purity of the charms
and simples, and leave the cure, they would say,
no better than a farrier’s.</p>

<p class='c004'>Our old collough, Jug Coyle, as she sat in a
corner of the hob, by the great long turf fire in
the kitchen, exactly in the position of the Indian
squaws, munching and mumbling for use an
apron-full of her morning’s gatherings in the fields,
used to talk at intervals very <i>sensibly</i> of her art.
“Ough! then, my dear sowl, (said she one evening,)
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>what would the poor Irishers have done in
owld times but for their colloughs? Such brutes
as you!” continued she, (looking at Butler, the
farrier of the family, who was seated fast asleep
on a bench at the opposite end of the hearth,)
“’tis you, and the likes of you, a curse on you,
root and branch! that starved the colloughs by
giving your poisons to both cows and quality. Sure
its the farriers’ and pothecaries’ drugs that kills all
the people-ay, and the horses and cattle too,” and
she shook her claw-like fist at the unconscious
farrier.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jug Coyle,” said I, “why are you so angry?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jug:—“Sure it’s not for myself, it’s for my
calling,” said she: “a thousand years before the
round towers were built (and nobody can tell <i>that</i>
time), the colloughs were greater nor any lady in
the country. We had plenty of charms in those
days, Master Jonah, till the farriers came, bad
luck to the race! Ough! may the curse of
Crummell light on yees all, breed, seed, and generation,
Larry Butler! not forgetting Ned Morrisy
of Clapook, the villanous cow-doctor, that
takes the good from the colloughs likewise, and
all—”</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Jug Coyle stopped short, as the farrier
opened his eyes, and she knew well that if Larry
Butler had a sup in, he would as soon beat an old
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>woman as any body else. She therefore resumed
munching her herbs, but was totally silenced.</p>

<p class='c004'>Larry Butler was one of the oldest and most
indispensable <i>attachés</i> of our family. Though nobody
remembered him a <i>boy</i>, he was as handy, as
fresh, and as <i>rational</i>, perhaps more so, than half
a century before. Short, broad, and bow-legged,
bone and muscle kept his body together—for flesh
was absent. His face, once extremely handsome,
still retained its youthful colouring—though broken
and divided: his sharp eye began to exhibit
the dimness of age: the long white hair had deserted
his high forehead, but fell, in no scanty
locks, down each side of his animated countenance.
He is before my eye at this moment—too
interesting, and, at the same time, odd a figure
ever to be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c004'>I had a great respect for old Butler: he was
very passionate, but universally licensed: he could
walk any distance, and always carried in his hand
a massive firing-iron. I have thus particularly
described the old man, as being one of the most
curious characters of his class I ever met in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c004'>Larry soon showed signs of relapsing into
slumber; but Jug, fearing it was a <i>fox’s sleep</i>
(an old trick of his), did not recommence her philippic
on the farriers, but went on in her simple
praise of the collough practice. “Sure,” said
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>she, “God never sent any disorder into a country
that he did not likewise send something to cure
it with.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, certainly, Jug,” said I, “it would be
rather bad treatment if we had no cures in the
country.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ough! that saying is like your dear father,”
said she, “and your grandfather before you, and
your great-grandfather who was before him agin.
Moreover,” pursued Jug, “God planted our cures
in the fields because there was no pothecaries.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very true, Jug,” said I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, then, Master Jonah,” resumed she, “if
God or the Virgin, and I’m sure I can’t say which
of them, planted the cures, sure they must have
made people who knew how to pick them up in
the fields, or what good is their growing there?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s no gainsaying that, Jug,” gravely
observed I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, then, it was to the colloughs, sure
enough, God gave the knowledge of picking the
cures up—because he knew well that they were
owld and helpless, and that it would be a charity
to employ them. When once they learned the
herbs, they were welcome every where; and
there was not <i>one</i> man died in his bed (the people
say) in owld times for <i>twenty</i> now-a-days.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of that there is no doubt, Jug,” said I,
“though there may be other reasons for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ough! God bless you agin, avourneen! any
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>how,” said Jug. “Well, then, they say it was
Crummell and his troopers, bad luck to their
sowls, the murdering villains! that brought the
first farriers (and no better luck to <i>them</i>!) to Ireland,
and the colloughs were kilt with the hunger.
The craturs, as the owld people tell, eat grass like
the beasts when the cows were all kilt by the
troopers and farriers—avourneen, avourneen!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Modern practitioners will perceive, by these
two specimens of our ancient <i>doctors</i>, that the
state of medicine in Ireland was totally different
from that in Italy. Surgery being likewise a
branch of the healing art, no doubt also differed in
the two countries, in a similar degree. I shall
therefore give a few <i>instances</i> of both medico-surgical
and surgico-medical practice fifty years ago
in Ireland; and if my talented friend, Lady Morgan,
will be so good as to inquire, she will find,
that though she has left medicine so entirely to her
lord, she may get an admirable <i>doctor</i> or two to introduce
into her next Irish <i>imaginations</i>—which I
hope will be soon forthcoming—certainly not sooner
than agreeable and welcome.</p>

<p class='c004'>I must here notice a revolution; namely, that of
late, since farriers have got a “step in the peerage,”
and are made commissioned officers in the
army, they think it proper to refine their pharmacopeia
so as to render it more congenial to their
new rank and station, and some horses are now
not only theoretically but practically placed on
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>more than a level with the persons who mount
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The practice of horse medicine is indeed so
completely revolutionised, that gas, steam, and
the chemistry of Sir Humphrey Davy, are resorted
to for the morbid affections of that animal in common
with those of a nobleman. The horse, now,
regularly takes his hot bath like my lord and lady,
James’ powders, refined liquorice, musk, calomel,
and laudanum, with the most “elegant extracts”
and delicate infusions. As if <i>Gulliver</i> were a prophet,
he literally described, in the reign of Queen
Anne, both the <i>English horse</i> and the <i>Irish peasant</i>
as they exist at the present moment. If the
lodging, clothing, cleaning, food, medicine, and
attendance of the modern Hoynhymm, be contrasted
with the pig-sty, rags, filth, neglect, and
hunger of the Yahoo, it must convince any honest
neutral that Swift (that greatest of Irishmen)
did not overcharge his satire. The sum lavished
upon the care of one Hoynhymm for <i>a single day</i>,
with little or nothing to do, is more (exclusive of
the farrier) than is now paid to five Irish Yahoos
for <i>twelve hours’</i> hard labour, with to feed, clothe,
lodge, and nourish <i>themselves</i>, and probably five
wives and twenty or thirty children, for the same
period, into the bargain.</p>

<p class='c004'>A few very curious cases may elucidate our ancient
practice of cure—a practice, I believe, never
even heard of in any other part of Europe. The
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>bite of a mad dog was to the Irish peasantry of all
things the most puzzling and terrific; and I am
sure I can scarcely guess what Doctor Morgan will
think of my veracity when I state the two modes
by which that horrible mania was neutralised or
finally put an end to.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the bite of a dog took place, every effort
was made to kill the beast, and if they succeeded,
it was never inquired whether he actually <i>was</i>, or
(as the colloughs used to say) <i>pretended to be</i> mad:
his liver was immediately taken out, dried by the
fire till quite hard, then reduced to powder, and
given in frequent doses with a draught of holy
or blessed water, to the patient for seven days.
If it happened that the saliva did not penetrate
the sufferer’s clothes, or if the dog was <i>not</i>
actually mad, it was then considered that the
patient was <i>cured</i> by drinking the dog’s liver and
holy water;—and if it so happened that the bite
set him barking, then the priest and farrier told
them it was the will of God that he should bark,
and they were contented either to let him die at
his leisure, or send him to heaven a little sooner
than was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class='c004'>The herbs of the colloughs were sometimes successfully
resorted to; whether accidental or actual
preventives or antidotes, it is not easy to determine:
but when I detail the ulterior remedy to
cure the hydrophobia in Ireland, or at least to
render it <i>perfectly innoxious</i>, I am well aware that
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>I shall stand a good chance of being honoured
by the periodicals with the appellation of a
“bouncer,” as on occasion of the former volumes:
but the ensuing case, as I can personally vouch
for the fact, I may surely give with tolerable confidence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such a dread had the Irish of the bite of a mad
dog, that they did not regard it as murder, but
absolutely as a legal and meritorious act, to smother
any person who had arrived at an advanced
stage of hydrophobia. If he made a noise similar
to barking, his hour of suffocation was seldom
protracted.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this mode of administering the <i>remedy</i>, it was
sometimes difficult to procure proper instruments;
for they conceived that <i>by law</i> the patient should
be smothered between two <i>feather</i>-beds,—one
being laid cleverly over him, and a sufficient number
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>of the neighbours lying on it till he was “out
of danger.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The only instance I am able to state from my
own knowledge occurred about the year 1781.
Thomas Palmer, of Rushhall, in Queen’s County,
was then my father’s land-agent, and at the same
time a very active and intelligent magistrate of
that county. He was, <i>gratis</i>, an oracle, lawyer,
poet, horse—cow—dog and man doctor, farmer,
architect, brewer, surveyor, and magistrate of all
work. He was friendly and good-natured, and
possessed one of those remarkable figures now so
rarely to be seen in society. I feel I am, as usual,
digressing;—however, be the digression what it
may, I cannot deny myself the pleasure of depicting
my old friend, and endeavouring to render
him as palpable to the vision of my reader as he
is at this moment to my own.</p>

<p class='c004'>Palmer was one of that race of giants for which
the rich and extensive barony of Ossory, in
Queen’s County (now the estate of the Duke of
Buckingham), was then and had long been celebrated.
His height was esteemed the <i>middle</i>
height in that county—namely, about six feet two
inches; he was bulky without being fat, and
strong, though not very muscular. He was, like
many other giants, <i>split up</i> too much, and his long
dangling limbs appeared still longer from their
clothing, which was invariably the same:—a pair
of strong buck-skin breeches, never <i>very</i> greasy, but
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>never free from grease; half jack-boots; massive,
long silver spurs, either of his own or of somebody’s
grandfather’s; a scarlet waistcoat with long skirts;
and a coat with “<i>all the cloth</i> in it.” These habiliments
rendered him altogether a singular but not
other than respectable figure. His visage made
amends for both his <i>outré</i> boots and breeches; it
was as well calculated as could be for a kind-hearted,
good-humoured, convivial old man. His
queue wig, with a curl at each side, had his grizzle
hair combed smoothly over the front of it; and
he seldom troubled the powder-puff, but when he
had got the “skins whitened,” in order to “dine in
good company.” He was the <i>hardest-goer</i> either at
kettle or screw (except Squire Flood of Roundwood)
of the whole grand-jury, for whose use he
made a new song every summer assize: and it
was from him I heard the very unanswerable argument,
“that if a man fills the bottom of his glass,
there can be no good reason why he should not
also fill the top of it; and if he empties the top of
his glass, he certainly ought in common civility to
pay the bottom the same compliment:”—no man
ever more invariably exemplified his own theorem.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thomas Palmer was hale and healthy;—his
fifty-seventh year had handed him over safe and
sound to its next neighbour: his property was
just sufficient (and no more) to gallop side by side
with his hospitality. When at home, his boiler
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>was seldom found bubbling without a corned
round withinside it; and a gander or cock turkey
frequently danced at the end of a string before the
long turf fire. Ducks, hares, chickens, or smoked
ham, often adorned the sides of his table; whilst
apple-dumplings in the centre and potatoes at
cross corners completed a light snack for five or
six seven-feet Ossoronians, who left no just reason
to the old cook and a couple of ruddy ploughmen,
(who attended as <i>butlers</i>,) to congratulate themselves
upon the <i>dainty</i> appetites of their masters,
or the balance of nourishment left to liquidate the
demand of their own stomachs. But, alas! those
pleasurable specimens of solid fare have passed
away for ever! As age advances, Nature diminishes
her weights and measures in our <i>consumption</i>,
and our early <i>pounds</i> and Scotch <i>pints</i> (<i>two
bottles</i>) are at length reduced to the miserable
rations of <i>ounces</i> and <i>glassfuls</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>At this magistrate’s <i>cottage</i>, which had as stout
a roof to it as any mansion in the county, I once
dined, about the year 1781, when the state of
medicine in Ireland was exemplified in a way that
neither Cullen, Darwin, Perceval, James, or any
other learned doctor ever contemplated, and
which I am convinced—had it been the practice
in Italy—Doctor Morgan would not have passed
over in total silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>We had scarcely finished such a meal as I have
particularised, and “got into the punch,” when a
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>crowd of men, women, and children, came up to
the door in great confusion, but respectfully took
off their hats and bonnets, and asked humbly to
speak to his worship.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tom Palmer seemed to anticipate their business,
and inquired at once “if Dan Dempsey of the
Pike (turnpike) was in the same way still?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ough! please your worship,” cried out twenty
voices together, “worse, your worship, worse
nor ever, death’s crawling upon him—he can’t
<i>stop</i>, and what’s the use in leaving the poor boy
in his pains any longer, your worship? We have
got two good feather-beds at the Pike, and we
want your worship’s leave to smother Dan Dempsey,
if your worship pleases.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ough avourneen! he growls and barks like
any mastiff dog, please your worship,” cried a
tremulous old woman, who seemed quite in terror.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You lie, Nancy Bergin,” said her older husband,
“Dan Dempsey does <i>not</i> bark like a <i>mastiff</i>;—it’s
for all the world like your worship’s
white lurcher, when she’s after the rabbits, so it
is!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He snapped three times at myself this morning,”
said another humane lady, “and the neighbours
said it were all as one, almost, as biting
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hush! hush!” said the magistrate, waving
his hand: “any of you who can read and write,
come in here.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>“Ough! there’s plenty of that sort, please
your worship,” said Maurice Dowling, the old
schoolmaster. “Sure it’s not ignorance I’d be
teaching my scholards every day these forty years,
except Sundays and holidays, at the Pike. There’s
plenty of swearing scholards here any how, your
worship.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come in any three of you, then, who can
clearly swear Dan Dempsey barks like a dog,—no
matter whether like a mastiff or a lurcher—and
attempts to bite.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The selection was accordingly made, and the
affidavit sworn, to the effect that “Dan Dempsey
had been bit by a mad dog; that he went mad
himself, barked like any greyhound, and had no
objection to bite whatever Christian came near
him. Squire Palmer then directed them to go
back to the Pike, and said they might smother
Dan Dempsey if he barked any more in the
morning; but told them to wait till then.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah, then, at what hour, please your worship?”
said Nan Bergin, accompanied by several
other female voices, whose owners seemed rather
impatient.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Three hours after day-break,” said the magistrate:
“but take care to send to Mr. Calcut, the
coroner, to come and hold his inquest after Dan’s
smothered. Take care of that, at your peril.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never fear, please your worship,” said Ned
Bergin.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>They then gathered into a sort of consultation
before the door, and bowing with the same respect
as when they came, all set off, to smother Dan
Dempsey of Rushhall Turnpike.</p>

<p class='c004'>The magistrate’s instructions were accurately
obeyed: Daniel barked, and was duly smothered
between two feather-beds, three hours after day-break
next morning, by the schoolmaster’s watch.
Mr. Calcut came and held his coroner’s inquest,
who brought in their verdict that the said “Daniel
Dempsey died <i>in consequence of a mad dog</i>!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The matter was not at that day considered the
least extraordinary, and was, in fact, never mentioned
except in the course of common conversation,
and as the subject of a paragraph in the
Leinster Journal.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is a singular circumstance, that the termination
of poor Palmer’s life resulted from his consistency
in strictly keeping his own aphorism which
I have before mentioned. He dined at my father’s
Lodge at Cullenagh; and having taken his <i>quantum
sufficit</i>, (as people who dined there generally
did,) became obstinate, which is frequently
the consequence of being pot-valiant, and insisted
on riding home, twelve or thirteen miles, in a dark
night. He said he had a couple of songs to write
for the high sheriff, which Mr. Boyce from
Waterford had promised to sing at the assizes;—and
that he always wrote best with a full stomach.
It was thought that he fell asleep; and that his
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>horse, supposing he had as much right to drink
freely as his master, had quietly paid a visit to his
accustomed watering-place, when, on the animal’s
stooping to drink, poor Palmer pitched over his
head into the pond, wherein he was found next
morning quite dead—though scarcely covered with
water, and grasping the long branch of a tree as if
he had been instinctively endeavouring to save
himself, but had not strength, owing to the overpowering
effect of the liquor. His horse had not
stirred from his side. His loss was, to my father’s
affairs, irreparable.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is very singular that nearly a similar death
occurred to an attorney, who dined at my father’s
about a month afterward—old Allen Kelly of Portarlington,
one of the most keen though cross-grained
attorneys in all Europe. He came to Cullenagh to
insist upon a settlement for some bills of costs he
had dotted up against my father to the tune of
fifty pounds. It being generally, in those times,
more convenient to country gentlemen to pay by
bond than by ready money—and always more
agreeable to the attorney, because he was pretty
sure of doubling his costs before the judgment was
satisfied, Allen Kelly said, that, out of <i>friendship</i>,
he’d take a <i>bond and warrant of attorney</i> for his
fifty pounds; though it was not taxed, which he
declared would only <i>increase</i> it wonderfully. The
bond and warrant, which he had ready filled up
in his pocket, were duly executed, and both parties
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>were pleased—my father to get rid of Allen
Kelly, and Allen Kelly to get fifty pounds for the
worth of ten. Of course he stayed to dine, put the
bond carefully into his breeches pocket, drank
plenty of port and hot punch, to keep him warm
on his journey, mounted his nag, reached Portarlington,
where he watered his nag (and <i>himself</i>
into the bargain). Hot punch, however, is a bad
balance-master, and so Allen fell over the nag’s
head, and the poor beast trotted home quite lonesome
for want of his master. Next day Allen
was found well bloated with the Barrow water;
indeed, swollen to full double his usual circumference.
In his pockets were found divers documents
which <i>had been</i> bonds, notes, and other
securities, and which he had been collecting
through the country: but unfortunately for his
administrators, the Barrow had taken pity on the
debtors, and whilst Allen was reposing himself in
the bed of that beautiful river, her naiads were
employed in picking his pocket, and there was
scarcely a bill, bond, note, or any acknowledgment,
where the fresh ink had not yielded up its
colouring; and neither the names, sums, dates, or
other written matters, of one out of ten, could be
by any means decyphered. In truth few of the
debtors were very desirous, on this occasion, of
turning <i>decypherers</i>, and my father’s bond (among
others) was from that day never even suggested

  <h2 class='c010'>SKINNING A BLACK CHILD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Lieutenant Palmer and his black servant—The Lieutenant’s sister marries Mr. George Washington, a “blood relation” of the American president—This lady presents her husband with a son and heir—Awkward circumstance connected with the birth of the infant—Curious and learned dissertation respecting “fancy-marks,” &amp;c.—A <i>casus omissus</i>—Speculations and consultations—Doctor Bathron, surgeon and grocer—His suggestion respecting little Washington—Doctor Knaggs called in—Operation begun—Its ill success—“Black and all Black”—The operator’s dismay and despair—Final catastrophe of Master Washington.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another, and a not unpleasant, because not
fatal, incident may serve to illustrate the “state
of medicine and surgery,” between forty and fifty
years ago, in Ireland. It occurred near my brother’s
house, at Castlewood, and the same Lieutenant
Palmer, of Dureen, was a very interested
party in it. The thing created great merriment
among all the gossiping, tattling old folks, male
and female, throughout the district.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>The lieutenant having been in America, had
brought home a black lad as a servant, who resided
in the house of Dureen with the family. It
is one of the mysteries of nature, that infants
sometimes come into this world marked and
spotted in divers fantastical ways and places, a
circumstance which the faculty, so far as they
know any thing about it, consider as the sympathetic
effect either of external touch or ardent
imagination;—or, if neither of these are held to be
the cause, then they regard it as a sort of <i>lusus</i>
with which Dame Nature occasionally surprises,
and then (I suppose) laughs at the world, for marvelling
at her capriciousness,—a quality which she
has, as satirists pretend, plentifully bestowed on
the fairest part of the creation. Be this as it may,
the incident I am about to mention is in its way
unique; and whether the occasion of it proceeded
from sympathy, fancy, or touch, or exhibited a
regular <i>lusus Naturæ</i>, never has, and now never
can be unequivocally decided.</p>

<p class='c004'>A sister of the lieutenant, successively a very
good maiden, woman, and wife, had been married
to one Mr. George Washington, of the neighbourhood,
who, from his name, was supposed to be
some distant blood relation to the celebrated General
Washington; and, as that distinguished
individual had no children, all the old women and
other wiseacres of Durrow, Ballyragget, Ballyspellen,
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>and Ballynakill, made up their minds that
his Excellency, when dying, would leave a capital
legacy in America to his blood relation, Mr.
George Washington, of Dureen, in Ireland; who
was accordingly advised—and, with the aid
of the Rev. Mr. Hoskinson, clergyman of Durrow
(father to the present Vice Provost of Dublin University),
he took the advice—to write a dignified
letter to his Excellency, General George Washington
of Virginia, President, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. stating
himself to have the honour of entertaining hopes
that he should be enabled to show his Excellency,
by an undeniable pedigree (when he could procure
it) that he had a portion of the same blood
as his Excellency’s running in his humble veins.
The letter went on to state, that he had espoused
the sister of a British officer, who had had the
honour of being taken prisoner in America; and
that he, the writer, having reasonable expectation
of shortly fathering a young Mr. Washington, his
Excellency’s permission was humbly requested
for the child to be named his god-son: till the receipt
of which permission, the christening should
be kept open by his most faithful servant and distant
relation, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c004'>This epistle was duly despatched to his Excellency,
at Mount Vernon, in Virginia, and Mrs
George Washington, of Dureen, lost no time in
performing her husband’s promise. No joy ever
exceeded that which seized on Mr. Washington,
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>when it was announced that his beloved wife had
been taken ill, and was in excessive torture. The
entire household, master included, were just seated
at a comfortable and plentiful dinner; the first
slices off the round, or turkey, were cut and tasted;
some respectable old dames of the neighbourhood
had just stepped in to congratulate the family on
what would occur, and hear all that was going
forward at this critical, cheerful, and happy moment
of anticipation, when Mrs. Gregory (the <i>lady’s
doctor</i>), who was, in her own way, a very shrewd,
humorous kind of body, and to whom most people
in that country under thirty-five years of age
had owed their existence, entered the apartment
to announce the happy arrival of as fine a healthy
little boy as could be, and that Mrs. Washington
was as well, or indeed rather better, than might
be expected <i>under the circumstances</i>. A general
cheer by the whole company followed, and bumpers
of hot punch were drunk with enthusiasm to
the success and future glory of the <i>young</i> General
Washington.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Gregory at length beckoned old Mrs.
Palmer to the window with a mysterious air, and
whispered something in her ear; on hearing
which, Mrs. Palmer immediately fell flat on the
floor, as if dead. The old dames hobbled off to
her assistance, and Mrs. Gregory affected to feel
strongly herself about something,—ejaculating, loud
enough to be generally heard, and with that sort
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>of emphasis people use when they wish to persuade
us they are praying in downright earnest, “God’s
will be done!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What about?” said the lieutenant, bristling
up:—“I suppose my mother has taken a glass too
much: it is not the first time!—she’ll soon come
round again, never fear. Don’t be alarmed, my
friends.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“God’s will be done!” again exclaimed the
oracular Mrs. Gregory.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the matter? What is all this about?”
grumbled the men. “Lord bless us! what can
it be?” squalled the women.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There cannot be a finer or stronger little boy
in the ’varsal world,” said Mrs. Gregory: “but,
Lord help us!” continued she, unable longer to
contain her overcharged grief, “It’s—it’s not so—so
<i>white</i> as it should be!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not white?” exclaimed every one of the company
simultaneously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,—O Lord, no!” answered Mrs. Gregory,
looking mournfully up to the ceiling in search of
heaven. Then casting her eyes wistfully around
the company, she added—“God’s will be done!
but the dear little boy is—is—quite <i>black</i>!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“<i>Black! black!</i>” echoed from every quarter of
the apartment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“As black as your hat, if not <i>blacker</i>,” replied
Mrs. Gregory.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! Oh—h!” groaned Mr. Washington.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>“Oh! Oh—h!” responded Mrs. Gregory.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Blood and ouns!” said the lieutenant.—“See
how I am shaking,” said the midwife, taking up a
large glass of potsheen and drinking it off to settle
her nerves.</p>

<p class='c004'>What passed afterward on that evening may be
easily surmised: but the next day Mrs. Gregory,
the <i>sage femme</i>, came into Castle Burrow to “prevent
<i>mistakes</i>,” and tell the affair to the neighbours
in her own way; that is, partly in whispers, partly
aloud, and partly by nods and winks—such as old
ladies frequently use when they wish to divulge
more than they like to speak openly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sufficient could be gathered, however, to demonstrate
that young Master Washington had not
one white, or even <i>gray</i> spot on his entire body,
and that some <i>frizzled</i> hair was already beginning
to show itself on his little pate; but that no nurse
could be found who would give him a drop of
nourishment, even were he famishing—all the
women verily believing that, as Mrs. Washington
was herself an unexceptionable wife, it must be a
son of the d—l by a dream, and nothing else than
an imp. However, Mr. Hoskinson, the clergyman,
soon contradicted this report by assuring
the Protestants that the day for that sort of miracle
had been for some centuries over, and that the
infant was as fine, healthy, natural, and sprightly a
little negro as ever came from the coast of Guinea.</p>

<p class='c004'>Never was there such a buzz and hubbub in any
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>neighbourhood as now took place in and about the
town of Castle Durrow. Every body began to <i>compute
periods</i> and form conjectures; and though it
was universally known that red wine, &amp;c. &amp;c.
cast on the mamma, often leaves marks upon children,
yet censorious and incredulous people persisted
in asserting, that such marks only came in
spots or splashes, when the person of a lady
happened to be actually touched by the colouring
matter: but that no child could be black, and
<i>all</i> black, unless in a <i>natural</i> way. Among the
lower orders, however, the thing was settled at
once in the most plausible and popular manner,
and set down as downright witchcraft and nothing
else: and suspicion fell on old Betty Hogan of the
Seven Sisters, near Ballyspellen, who was <i>known</i>
to be a witch, and able to raise the devil at Hallow
Eve, to turn smocks, and tell fortunes; and she
was verily seen by more than one to go into the
Cave of Dunmore with a coal-black cur dog (without
tail or ears) after her, the very night and
minute Mrs. Washington was delivered of the
devil; and nobody ever saw the cur dog before or
since.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Washington and the lieutenant were, however,
by no means at ease upon the subject of this
freak of Nature, and were well warranted in their
dissatisfaction; as at length all the old women
agreed in believing, that the black lad from America
was nothing else but the devil disguised,
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>who had followed the lieutenant as a servant
boy, to gain over the family, and particularly Mrs.
Washington, as Satan did Eve;—and that he
ought to be smothered by the priests, or at least
transported out of the country, before he did any
more mischief—or there would not be a white
child in the whole barony the next season.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Palmer was of course high in blood
for the honour of his sister, and Mr. Washington
cock-a-hoop for the character of his wife: and so
great was their ire, that it was really believed the
black boy would have been put down a draw-well,
as the people threatened,—that being the approved
method of getting rid of a devil whenever he
showed his face in that part of the country: but
as, possibly, Betty Hogan might be a better judge
of him than themselves, they suspended the execution
till they should bring the old witch and
confront her and <i>the devil</i> together—when of course
he would show his cloven foot, and they might
both be put into the well, if they did not take
every <i>taste</i> of the black off <i>Master Washington</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The father and uncle decided more calmly and
properly to lay the whole affair before a consultation
of doctors, to know if it was not a regular
<i>imagination mark</i>—whether a child might not be
marked by mere fancy, without the marking material
(such as grapes, currants, or the like,) touching
the mother; and lastly, why, as children in
general are only partially marked, this child was
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>not <i>spotted</i> like others, but as black as ebony every
inch of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>All the doctors in the neighbourhood were called
in to the consultation. Old Butler, the farrier
(heretofore mentioned), came with all expedition
to Dureen, and begged leave to give his opinion
and offer his services, wishing to see Master
Washington before the doctors arrived, as he had
a secret for turning any skin ever so brown as
white as milk!</p>

<p class='c004'>On seeing Master Washington, however, he declared
he was <i>too</i> black <i>entirely</i> for his medicines,
or any body else’s. “The devil so black a crethur,”
says he, “ever I saw, except Cornet
French’s <i>Black and all Black</i>, that beat the Pandreen
mare for the King’s hundred at the races of
Gort:—the devil a white hair had <i>he</i> from muzzle to
tail, good, bad, or indifferent. By my sowl! it’s a
neat crust poor George Washington has got to
mumble any how! I never saw luck or grace
come of the negers, bad luck to them all!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The day for the consultation being fixed, several
apothecaries and bone-setters attended at the
house of Mr. George Bathron, of Dureen, grocer,
wine-merchant, surgeon, apothecary, druggist, and
physician.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first point stated and unanimously agreed
on, was, “that the child was black.” The reasons
for that colour being universal on the young gentleman
were not quite so clear. At length Dr.
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>Bathron, finding he had the lead, and having been
some years at school when a boy, and likewise
apprenticed to a grocer and apothecary at Ballyragget,
where he learned several technical words
in the Latin tongue; finding, besides, that he had
an excellent opportunity to prove his learning to
those less educated,—declared with great gravity
that he had read many authors upon the subject
of <i>marks</i>, and could take upon himself positively
to assert that the child was (according to all
authority on such matters) a <i>casus omissus</i>. The
others, not being exactly sure either of the shape,
size, or colour, of a <i>casus omissus</i>, thought it
better to <i>accede</i> to what they did not <i>comprehend</i>,
and all subscribed to the opinion that the child
was a <i>casus omissus</i>. It was immediately circulated
outside the house, that all the doctors
found the child to be a <i>casus omissus</i>; and old
Skelton, who had been a trooper in Germany, declared
that a doctor there told him that was
the true surname of a devil incarnate. And the
prevailing notion then was, that the black lad,
old Betty Hogan, the witch, and Master Washington,
should all be put down the draw-well together,
to save the other married women of the
country from bearing devils instead of children.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <i>doctors</i>, however, having given their opinion,
were extremely ticklish in taking any step
with a <i>casus omissus</i>; and not wishing to pitch
themselves against any infernal personification,
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>left future proceedings to the entire management
of Dr. Bathron.</p>

<p class='c004'>Doctor Bathron was a smart, squat, ruddy, jovial
apothecary, and he was also a professed poet,
who had made some celebrated odes on the birthday
of Miss Flower, Lord Ashbrooke’s sister,
when she visited Castle Durrow; and on this occasion
he required a fortnight to make up his mind
as to the best proceedings to bring the skin to its
proper colour. Having, by search of old book-stalls
in Dublin (whither he went for the purpose),
found an ancient treatise, translated from the
work of the high German Doctor Cratorious (who
flourished in the fourteenth century), on <i>skinning</i>
certain parts of the body to change the colour or
complexion, or effectually to disguise criminals
who had escaped from prison;—by which means,
likewise, disfiguring marks, freckles, moles, &amp;c.
might be removed,—Doctor Bathron decided, that
if this could be done partially, why not on the
entire body, by little and little, and not skinning
one spot till the last should be healed? He therefore
stated to Mr. Washington, and all the good
family of Dureen, that he would take upon himself
to <i>whiten</i> the child—as he was perfectly satisfied
the black skin was merely the outside, or
scarf-skin, and that the real skin and flesh underneath
were the same as every body else’s.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mode of operating was now the subject of
difficulty. It was suggested, and agreed on, to
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>call in Mr. Knaggs, the doctor of Mount Meleck,
who, though he had injured his character as a
practitioner of judgment by attempting to cut off
the head of Sam Doxy of the Derrys, as hereinafter
mentioned, had at the same time proved
himself a skilful operator, having gashed boldly
into the nape of Mr. Doxy’s neck without touching
the spinal marrow, which a bungler needs must
have done. He had also acquired the reputation
of science by writing a treatise on the Spa of
Ballyspellen, which the inn-keeper <i>there</i> had
employed him to compose, in order to bring
customers to his house to drink the waters as
“a specific for numerous disorders, when mixed
in due proportion with excellent wines, which
might be had very reasonable at the sign of the
Fox and Piper, at Ballyspellen,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c004'>This man, in fine, together with Doctor Bathron,
undertook to bring Master Washington to a proper
hue by detaching the exterior black <i>pelt</i> which
was so disagreeable to the family, and letting the
natural white skin, which they had no doubt was
concealed under it, come to light—thereby restoring
the boy, as he ought to be, to his happy
parents.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll gain immortal honour,” said the grandmother:
“I am sure they will all be bound to
pray for you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The state of practice in Ireland suggested but
two ways of performing this notable operation—one
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>purely surgical, the other surgico-medical:
namely, either by gradually flaying with the knife,
or by blisters.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was at length settled to begin the operation
the ensuing week, previously preparing the heir-at-law
by medicine to prevent inflammation; the
first attempt was to be on a small scale, and the
operation to be performed in Doctor Bathron’s own
surgery;—and he being still undecided whether
the scalpel and forceps, or Spanish flies, would
be the most eligible mode of skinning Master
Washington, determined to try both ways at once,
one on each arm, and to act in future according
as he saw the skin yield easiest.</p>

<p class='c004'>Most people conceived that, as a blister always
raises the skin, it would be the readiest agent in
loosening and carrying off the black one that had
created so much uneasiness in the present instance:—the
doctor’s doubts as to which, were,
that the blister alone might not rise regularly, but
operate at one place better than at another—in
which case the child might be <i>piebald</i>, which would
make him far worse than before.</p>

<p class='c004'>The operation at length proceeded, and Lieutenant
Palmer himself recounted to me every part
of the incident. A strong blister, two inches by
three, was placed on the child’s right arm, and
being properly covered, remained there without
inflicting any torture for above an hour. The
left arm was reserved for the scalpel and forceps,
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>and the operator entertained no doubt whatever
of complete success.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mode he pursued was very <i>scientific</i>; he
made two parallel slashes as deep as he could in
reason, about three inches down the upper part of
the arm, and a cross one, to introduce the forceps
and strip the loose black skin off, when he could
snip it away at the bottom, and leave the white
or rather red flesh underneath, to generate a new
skin, and show the proper colouring for a godchild
of General Washington.</p>

<p class='c004'>All eyes were now rivetted to the spot. The
women cried in an under key to Master George,
who roared. “Hush, hush, my dear,” said the
Doctor, “you don’t know what’s good for you, my
little innocent!” whilst he applied the forceps, to
strip off the skin like a <i>surtout</i>. The skin was
tight, and would not come away cleverly with the
first tug, as the doctor had expected; nor did any
thing <i>white</i> appear, though a sufficiency of red
blood manifested itself.</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor was greatly surprised. “I see,”
said he, “it is somewhat deeper than we had
conceived. We have not got deep enough.” Another
gash on each side; but the second gash had
no better success. Doctor Bathron seemed desperate;
but conceiving that in so young a subject
one short cut—be it ever so deep—could do
no harm, his hand shook, and he gave the
scalpel its full force, till he found it touch the
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>bone. The experiment was now complete; he
opened the wound, and starting back, affected to
be struck with horror, threw down his knife,
stamped and swore the child was in fact either
the devil or a <i>lusus Naturæ</i>, for that he could see
the very bone, and the child was actually coal-black
<i>to</i> the bone, and the bone black also, and
that he would not have taken a thousand guineas
to have given a single gash to a thing which was
clearly supernatural—actually dyed in grain.
He appeared distracted; however, the child’s arm
was bound up, a good poultice put over it, the
blister hastily removed from the other arm, and
the young gentleman, fortunately for Doctor
Bathron, recovered from the scarification, and lived
with an old dry-nurse for four or five years. He
was then killed by a cow of his <i>father’s</i> horning
him, and died with the full reputation of having
been a devil in reality, which was fully corroborated
by a white sister of his, and his mother, (as I heard,)
departing about the very same time, if not on the
next day. It was said he took their souls away
with him, to make his peace with his master for
staying so long.</p>

<p class='c004'>Doctor George Bathron, who was the pleasantest
united grocer and surgeon in the county, at length
found it the best policy to tell this story himself,
and by that means neutralise the ridicule of it.
He often told it to me, whilst in company with
Mr. Palmer; and by hearing both versions, I obtained
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>full information about the circumstance,
which I relate as a very striking example of the
mode in which we managed a <i>lusus Naturæ</i> when
we <i>caught</i> one in Ireland five and forty years
ago.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>THE FARRIER AND WHIPPER-IN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Tom White, the whipper-in of Blandsfort—An unlucky leap—Its consequences—Tom given over by the <i>Faculty</i>—Handed to the farrier—Larry Butler’s preparations—New way to <i>stand fast</i>—The actual cautery—Ingredients of a “charge”—Tom cured <i>intirely</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom White, a whipper-in at my father’s at
Blandsfort, had his back crushed by leaping his
horse into a gravel pit, to pull off the scut of a
hare. The horse broke his neck, the hare was
killed, and the whipper-in, to all appearance, little
better; and when we rode up, there lay three
carcases “all in a row.” However (as deaths
generally confer an advantage upon some survivor),
two of the <i>corpses</i> afforded good cheer next
day:—we ate the hare, the hounds ate the horse,
and the worms would certainly have made a meal
of Tom White, had not old Butler, the farrier,
taken his cure in hand, after Doctor Ned Stapleton,
of Maryborough, the genuine bone-setter of
that county, had given him up as broken-backed
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>and past all skill. As has been already seen, our
practice of pharmacy, medicine, and surgery in
Ireland, fifty years ago, did not correspond with
modern usages; and though our old operations
might have had a trifle more of <i>torture</i> in them—either
from bluntness of knives or the mode of
<i>slashing</i> a patient; yet, in the end, I conceive that
few more lives are saved by hacking, hewing, and
thrusting, <i>scientifically</i>, according to modern practice,
than there were by the old trooper-like
fashion.</p>

<p class='c004'>I was in Blandsfort House when Mr. Jemmy
Butler, our hereditary farrier, who had equal skill—according
to the old school—in the treatment
of dogs, cows, and horses, as well as in rat-catching,
began and concluded his medico-surgical cure
of Tom White: I can therefore recount with tolerable
fidelity the successful course adopted
toward that courageous sportsman.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tom’s first state of insensibility soon gave way;
and incontrovertible proofs of his existence followed,
in sundry deep groans, and now and then
a roaring asseveration that his back was broke.
He entreated us to send off for his <i>clergy</i> without
any delay, or the reverend father would not find
him in this world. However, Mr. Butler, who
had no great belief in any world either above or
below the Queen’s County, declared, “that if the
clergy came, he’d leave Tom White to die, as he
well knew Tom was a thief; and if any clergy
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>botheration was made about his sowl, it would
only tend to irritate and inflame his hurt.” But
he undertook to give him a better <i>greasing</i> than all
the priests in the barony, if they should be seven
years anointing him with the best salvation oil
ever invented.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tom acquiesced; and, in fear of death, acknowledged
“he was a great thief, sure enough, but if
he recovered, he would <i>take up</i>, and tell all he had
done, without a word of a lie, to Father Cahill of
Stradbally, who was always a friend to the poor
sarvants.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Butler now commenced his cure, at the
performance of which, every male in the house,
high and low, was called on to be present. The
farrier first stripped Tom to his shirt, and then
placed him flat on the great kitchen table, with his
face downward; and having (after being impeded
by much roaring and kicking) tied a limb fast to
each leg of it—(so as to make a St. Andrew’s cross
of him) he drew a strong table-cloth over the
lower part of the sufferer’s body; and tying the
corners underneath the table, had the pleasure of
seeing Tom White as snug and fast as he could
wish, to undergo any degree of torture without
being able to shift a quarter of an inch.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Butler then walked round in a sort of
triumph, every now and then giving the knots a
pull, to tighten them, and saying, “Mighty well,—mighty
good! Now <i>stand fast</i>, Tom.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>Tom’s back being thus duly bared, the <i>doctor</i>
ran his immense thumb from top to bottom along
the spine, with no slight degree of pressure; and
whenever the whipper-in roared loudest, Mr.
Butler marked the spot he was touching with a
lump of chalk. Having, in that way, ascertained
the tender parts, he pressed them with all his
force, as if he were kneading dough—just, as he
said, to <i>settle the joints</i> quite even. No bull in the
midst of five or six bull-dogs tearing him piecemeal
could, even in his greatest agonies, amuse the
baiters better, or divert them with more tremendous
roars, than the whipper-in did during the
greatest part of this operation.</p>

<p class='c004'>The operator, having concluded his <i>reconnoitring</i>,
proceeded to real action. He drew parallel lines
with chalk down Tom’s back—one on each side
the back-bone; at particular points he made a
cross stroke, and at the <i>tender parts</i> a <i>double</i> one;
so that Tom had a complete ladder delineated on
his back, as if the doctor intended that something
should mount by it from his waistband to his cravat.</p>

<p class='c004'>The preliminaries being thus gone through, and
Mr. Butler furnished with a couple of red-hot
irons, such as maimed horses are fired with, he
began, in a most deliberate and skilful manner, to
fire Tom according to the rules and practice of the
<i>ars veterinaria</i>. The poor fellow’s bellowing,
while under the actual cautery, all the people
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>said, they verily believed was the loudest ever
heard in that country since the massacre of Mullymart.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
This part of the operation, indeed, was
by no means superficially performed, as Mr. Butler
<i>mended</i> the lines and made them all of a uniform
depth and colour, much as the writing-master
mends the letters and strokes in a child’s copy-book:
and as they were very straight and regular,
and too well <i>broiled</i>, to suffer any effusion of red
blood, Tom’s back did not look much the worse for
the tattooing. In truth, if my readers recollect
the excellent mode of making a cut down each
side of a saddle of mutton, just to elicit the brown
gravy, they will have a good idea of the longitudinal
cauteries in question. On three or four of
the tender places before mentioned Mr. Butler
drew his transverse cross bars, which quite took
off the uniform appearance, and gave a sort of
<i>garnished</i> look to the whole drawing, which seemed
very much to gratify the operator, who again walked
round and round <i>the body</i> several times with a
red-hot iron in his hand, surveying, and here and
there retouching the ragged or uneven parts.
This <i>finishing</i> rendered the whipper-in rather
<i>hoarse</i>, and his first roars were now changed to
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>softer notes—somewhat as an opera singer occasionally
breaks into his falsetto.</p>

effect; and it is, altogether, one of the most remarkable traditionary
tales of that country.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>“Howld your bother,” said Mr. Butler, to
whom Tom’s incessant shrieking had become very
disagreeable: “howld your <i>music</i>, I say, or I’ll
put a touch<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a> on your nose as tight as yourself did
on Brown Jack, when I was firing the ring-bone
out of him: you’re a greater beast yourself nor
ever Brown Jack was.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An instrument used in the practice of farriers. It is a
piece of cord passed round the nose of a horse (being the most
sensitive part of that animal); and being twisted tight by a
short stick, it creates a torture so exquisite, that all other tortures
go for nothing. Therefore, when a horse is to have his
tail cut off, or his legs burned, &amp;c., a touch is put upon his
nose, the extreme pain whereof absorbs that of the operation,
and, as they term it, makes the beast “<i>stay easy</i>.”</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Mr. Butler having partly silenced the whipper-in
through fear of the <i>touch</i>, the second part of the
process was undertaken—namely, depositing what
is termed by farriers the cold charge, on the back of
Tom White. However, on this occasion the regular
<i>practice</i> was somewhat varied, and the <i>cold</i>
charge was nearly boiling hot when placed upon
the raw <i>ladder</i> on the whipper-in’s back. I saw
the <i>torture</i> boiled in a large iron ladle, and will
mention the ingredients, just to show that they
were rather more exciting than our milk-and-water
charges of the present day:—viz. Burgundy
pitch, black pitch, diaculum, yellow wax,
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>white wax, mustard, black resin, white resin, sal
ammoniac, bruised hemlock, camphor, Spanish
flies, and oil of origanum, boiled up with spirits
of turpentine, onion juice, and a glass of whisky;
it was kept simmering till it became of a proper
consistence for application, and was then <i>laid on</i>
with a painter’s brush, in the same way they calk
a pleasure-boat. Four coats of this savoury substance
did the farrier successively apply, each
one as the former began to cool. But, on the first
application, even the dread of the touch could
not restrain Tom White’s vociferation. After this
had settled itself in the chinks, he seemed to
be quite stupid, and tired of roaring, and lay
completely passive, or rather insensible, while
Mr. Butler <i>finished</i> to his taste; dotting it over
with short lamb’s-wool as thick as it would stick,
and then another coat of the unction, with an
addition of wool; so that, when completed by
several layers of charge and lamb’s-wool, Tom’s
back might very well have been mistaken for a
saddle of Southdown before it was skinned. A
thin ash board was now neatly fitted to it down
Tom’s spine by the carpenter, and made fast with
a few short nails driven into the charge. I believe
none of them touched the quick, as the charge
appeared above an inch and a half thick, and it was
only at the blows of the hammer that the patient
seemed to feel extra sensibility. Tom was now
untied and helped to rise: his woolly carcase was
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>bandaged all round with long strips of a blanket,
which being done, the operation was declared to
be completed, in less than three quarters of an
hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>The other servants now began to make merry
with Tom White. One asked him, how he liked
purgatory?—another, if he’d “stop thieving,” after
that <i>judgment</i> on him?—a third, what more could
Father Cahill do for him? <i>Doctor</i> Butler said but
little: he assumed great gravity, and directed “that
the whipper-in should sit up stiff for seven days
and nights, by which time the <i>juices would be
dried on him</i>; after that he might lay down, if he
<i>could</i>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This indeed was a very useless permission, as
the patient’s tortures were now only in their infancy.
So soon as the charge got cold and stiff in
the nitches and fancy figures upon his back, he
nearly went mad; so that for a few days they
were obliged to strap him with girths to the head
of his bed to make him “stay easy;” and sometimes
to gag him, that his roars might not disturb
the company in the dining parlour. Wallace the
piper said that Tom’s roarings put him quite <i>out</i>:
and an elderly gentleman who was on a visit with
us, and who had not been long married to a young
wife, said his bride was so shocked and alarmed at
the groans and “pullaloes” of Tom White, that
she could think of nothing else.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the poor fellow’s pains had altogether subsided,
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>and the swathing was off, he cut one of the
most curious figures ever seen: he looked as if he
had a stake driven through his body; and it was
not till the end of four months that Mr. Butler
began to pour sweet oil down his neck, between
his back and the charge, which he continued to do
daily for about another month, till the charge
gradually detached itself, and broken-backed Tom
was declared cured: in truth, I believe he never
felt any inconvenience from his fall afterward.</p>

<p class='c004'>This mode of cauterising the people was then
much practised by the old farriers, often with
success; and I never recollect any fatal effects
happening in consequence.</p>

<p class='c004'>The farriers’ rowelling also was sometimes had
recourse to, to prevent swellings from coming to
a head: and I only heard of two fatalities arising
herefrom; one, in the case of a half-mounted gentleman
at Castle Comber, who died of a locked
jaw; and another, in that of a shopkeeper at
Borris, in Ossory, who expired from mortification
occasioned by a tow and turpentine rowell being
used to carry off an inflammation.</p>

Palmer’s successful mode of treatment—Recovery of the corpse.</p>

<p class='c006'>In addition to my preceding illustrations of the
former state of medicine and surgery in Ireland,
I cannot omit a couple of convincing proofs of the
<i>intuitive knowledge</i> possessed by Irish practitioners
in my early days. They present scenes at which
I was myself present, and one of which was the
most distressing I had witnessed, while the other
was more amusing at its conclusion than any
operation I ever saw performed by any, either of
the farriers or colloughs of Ireland.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>Doctor Knaggs, the hero of the second incident,
was a tall, raw-boned, rough, dirty apothecary;
but he suited the neighbours, as they said he had
“the skill in him,” and was “mighty successful.”
Sam Doxy, his patient, was, on the contrary, a
broad, strong, plethoric, half-mounted gentleman.
He had his lodge, as he called it, in the midst of a
<i>derry</i> (a bog), drank his gallon of hot punch to keep
out the damp, and devoured numerous cock turkeys,
and cows that were past <i>child-bearing</i>, to
keep down the potsheen. Every neighbour that
could get to him was welcome, and <i>the road</i> was
seldom <i>in a fit state</i> to permit their going away
again quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first of these anecdotes I still relate with
some pain, though forty-five years and more have
of course blunted the feeling I experienced on its
occurrence; and as I shall soon be in the same
situation myself as the parties now are, I can,
comparatively speaking, look lightly on an event
which, in youth, health, and high blood, was quite
chilling to my contemplation.</p>

<p class='c004'>The father of the late Judge Fletcher of the
Common Pleas was an <i>actual</i> physician at Mount
Melec, about seven miles from my father’s. He
was a smart, intelligent, and very humorous,
but remarkably diminutive doctor. He attended
my father in his last moments, in conjunction with
the family practitioner, Doctor Dennis Mulhall,
whose appearance exactly corresponded with that
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>of Doctor Slop, save that his paunch was doubly
capacious, and his legs, in true symmetry with his
carcase, helped to <i>waddle</i> him into a room. He was
a matter-of-fact doctor, and despised <i>anatomy</i>.
His features had been so confused and entangled
together by that unbeautifying disorder, the smallpox,
(which I have so often alluded to,) that it
almost required a chart to find their respective
stations.</p>

<p class='c004'>These two learned gentlemen attended my poor
father with the greatest assiduity, and daily prescribed
for him a certain portion of every drug the
Stradbally apothecary could supply: but these
were not very numerous; and as every thing loses
its vigour by age, so the Stradbally drugs, having
been some years waiting for customers (like the
landlord of the Red Cow in “John Bull”), of
course fell off in their efficacy, till at length they
each became, what the two doctors ultimately
turned my poor father into—a <i>caput mortuum</i>.
Notwithstanding the drugs and the doctors, indeed,
my father held out nearly ten days; but finally,
as a matter of course, departed this world. I was
deeply and sincerely grieved. I loved him affectionately,
and never after could reconcile myself
to either of his medical attendants. I had overheard
their last consultation, and from that time to
this, am of opinion, that one doctor is as good as,
if not better than, five hundred. I shall never forget
the dialogue. After discussing the weather and
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>prevalence of diseases in the county, they began
to <i>consult</i>.—“What do you say to the <i>pulveres Jacobi</i>?”
said Dr. Mulhall (the family physician).</p>

<p class='c004'>“We are three days too late,” smirked Doctor
Fletcher.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What think you then of cataplasmus, or the
<i>flies</i>?—Eh! Doctor, eh! the flies?” said Mulhall.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The flies won’t rise in time,” replied Doctor
Fletcher:—“too late again!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I fear so,” said Mulhall.</p>

<p class='c004'>“’Tis a pity, Doctor Mulhall, you did not suggest
blistering breast and spine sooner: you know
it was not my business, as I was only <i>called in</i>:—I
could not duly <i>suggest</i>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why,” replied Doctor Mulhall, “I thought
of it certainly, but I was unwilling to <i>alarm the
family</i> by so definitive an application, unless in
<i>extremis</i>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’re in <i>extremis</i> now,” said Doctor Fletcher—“he!
he!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very true—very true,” rejoined Doctor Mulhall;
“but Nature is too strong for art; she takes
her way in spite of us!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Unless, like a wife, she’s kept down at first,”
said Fletcher—“he! he! he!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps I was rather too discreet and delicate,
doctor; but if the colonel can still get down
the <i>pulveres Jacobi</i>—” said Mulhall.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He can’t!” said Fletcher.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>“Then we can do no more for the patient,”
replied Mulhall.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing <i>more</i>,” said Fletcher; “so you had
better break your ‘<i>give-over</i>’ to the family as tenderly
as possible. That’s your business, you
know: there is no use in my staying.” And so,
as the sun rose, Doctor Fletcher jumped into his
little cabriolet, and I heard him say in parting,
“This is no jest, I fear, to his family.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The next day I lost my father; and never did
grief show itself more strong, or general, than on
that mournful occasion. There was not a dry eye
amongst his tenantry. My mother was distracted:
for more than thirty years that they had been
united, a single difference of opinion was never
expressed between them. His sons loved him as
a brother; and the attachment was mutual. His
person was prepossessing—his manners those of a
man of rank—his feelings such as became a man of
honour. He had the mien of a gentleman, and
the heart of a philanthropist; but he was careless
of his concerns, and had too rustic an education.
He left large landed estates, with large incumbrances
to overwhelm them; and thirteen children
survived to lament his departure.</p>

<p class='c004'>After I was called to the bar, Counsellor Fletcher,
the doctor’s son (already mentioned in a former
Vol.), was in the best of practice. On my first circuit,
I did not know him, and of course wished to
make acquaintance with my seniors. Lord Norbury
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>went circuit as judge at the same time I went
first as barrister; he therefore can be no <i>juvenile</i> at
this time of day.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fletcher was, as has already been mentioned,
of very uncertain humour, and when not pleased,
extremely repulsive. The first day I was on circuit
he came into the bar-room, perhaps tired, or—what
was far worse to him—hungry, for nothing
ruffled Fletcher so much as waiting for dinner.
Wishing to lose no time in making acquaintance
with any countryman and brother barrister, and
supposing he was endowed with the same degree
of urbanity as other people, I addressed him in
my own civil, but perhaps over-vivacious manner.
He looked gruff, and answered my first question
by some monosyllable. I renewed my address
with one of the standing interrogatories resorted
to by a man who wishes to fall into conversation.—Another
monosyllable.</p>

<p class='c004'>I was touched:—“You don’t know me, perhaps,
Counsellor Fletcher?” said I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not as yet, sir,” said Fletcher.</p>

<p class='c004'>I was angry:—“Then I’ll refresh your memory,”
said I. “Your father <i>killed</i> mine.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The barristers present laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope you don’t mean to revenge the circumstance
on <i>me</i>, sir?” said Fletcher, with a sardonic
smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That,” said I, “depends entirely on your
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>making me an apology for your father’s ignorance.
I forgive <i>your own</i>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He seemed surprised at the person he had to
deal with, but no increase of ire was apparent.
He looked, however, rather at a loss. The laugh
was now entirely against him, when Warden
Flood (my predecessor in the Admiralty), who was
then father of the circuit bar, happened to come
in, and formally introduced me as a new member.</p>

<p class='c004'>After that time Fletcher and I grew very intimate:—he
had several good qualities, and these
induced me to put up with many of his humours.
He was a very clever man, possessing good legal
information; had a clear and independent mind,
and never truckled to any one because he was
great. He often wrangled, but never quarrelled
with me, and I believe I was one of the few who
maintained a sincere regard for him. He was intimate
with Judge Moore, who now sits in his
place, and was the most familiar friend I had at
Temple. I have alluded to Judge Fletcher incidentally,
as a public character who could not be
bribed to support the Union, and was appointed a
judge by the Duke of Bedford during his short
viceroyalty.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have introduced Doctor Fletcher’s medical
practice in my glance at the Irish <i>faculty</i>, the
more particularly, because I was present at another
consultation held with him, which was (as I
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>hinted at the commencement of this sketch) connected
with as droll an incident as any could be,
little short of terminating fatally.</p>

<p class='c004'>I rode with Mr. Flood, of Roundwood, to the
meeting of a turnpike-board, held at Mount Rath,
a few miles from my father’s house. One of the
half-mounted gentlemen already described, Sam
Doxy of the Derrys, being on his way to the same
meeting, just at the entrance of the town his
horse stumbled over a heap of earth, and, rolling
over and over (like the somerset of a rope-dancer),
broke the neck of his rider. The body
was immediately—as usual when country gentlemen
were slain in fox-hunting, riding home drunk
at nights, or the like—brought on a door, and laid
upon a bed spread on the floor at the next inn. Mr.
Knaggs, the universal prescriber, &amp;c. for the town
and vicinity, was sent for to inspect <i>the corpse</i>, and
Doctor Fletcher being also by chance in the place,
was called into the room to consult as to the <i>dead
man</i>, and vouch that the breath was out of the
body of Mr. Samuel Doxy of the Derrys.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two practitioners found he had no pulse,
not even a single <i>thump in his arteries</i> (as Doctor
Knaggs emphatically expressed it). They therefore
both shook their heads. His hands being felt,
were found to be cold. They shook their heads
again. The doctors now retired to the window,
and gravely consulted: first, as to the danger of
stumbling horses; and second, as to the probability
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>of the deceased having been sober. They then
walked back, and both declared it was “all over”
with Mr. Doxy of the Derrys. His neck was
broken—otherwise dislocated; his marrow-bones
(according to Dr. Knaggs) were disjointed; and
his death had of course been instantaneous. On
this decisive opinion being promulgated to the
turnpike-board, Dr. Fletcher mounted his pony,
and left the town, to <i>cure</i> some other patient.</p>

<p class='c004'>The coroner, Mr. Calcut, was sent for to hold
his inquest before Sam’s body could be “forwarded”
home to the Derrys; and Mr. Knaggs,
the apothecary, remained in the room, to see if any
<i>fee</i> might be stirring when his relations should
come to carry away the dead carcase; when, all
of a sudden, an exclamation of “by J—s!” burst
forth from Mr. Jerry Palmer (already mentioned)
of Dureen, near Castle Durrow, an intimate
acquaintance of Sam Doxy: “I don’t think he’s
dead at all:—my father often made him twice <i>deader</i>
at Dureen, with Dan Brennan’s double-proof, and
he was as well and hearty again as any dunghill
cock early in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not dead!” said Knaggs with surprise and
anger. “Is not dead, you say?—Lieutenant Jer
Palmer, you don’t mean to disparage my skill,
or injure my business in the town, I hope? There
is no more life left in Sam Doxy than in the leg of
that table.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lieutenant bristled up at the doctor’s contradiction.
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>“I don’t care a d—n, Pothecary
Knaggs, either for your skill, your business, or
yourself; but I say Sam Doxy is <i>not</i> dead, and
I repeat that I have seen him <i>twice as dead</i> at
Dureen, and likewise, by the same token, on the
day Squire Pool’s tenants of Ballyfair had a
great dinner in Andrew Harlem’s big room at
Maryborough.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pothecary Knaggs” was now much chagrined.
“Did you ever hear the like, gentlemen of the
turnpike-board?” said he. “Is it because the
lieutenant was in the American wars that he thinks
he knows a corpse as well as I do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No I don’t do that same,” said Palmer: “for
they say here that you have <i>made</i> as many dead
bodies yourself as would serve for a couple of
battles, and a few skirmishes into the bargain.
But I say <i>Sam</i> is not dead, by J—s!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well now, gentlemen,” said Knaggs, appealing
to public candour from the rough treatment of the
lieutenant, “you shall soon see, gentlemen, with
all your eyes that I am no <i>ignoramus</i>, as the lieutenant
seems to say.” Then opening his case of
instruments and strapping a large operation knife
on the palm of his fist, “now, gentlemen of the
turnpike-board,” pursued he, “I’ll convince you
all that Sam Doxy is as dead as Ballaghlanagh.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>Its a burning shame for you, Lieutenant Jer
Palmer, to be after running down a well-known
practitioner in this manner, in his own town. Gentlemen,
look here, now, I’ll show you that Sam
is dead. Living, indeed! Oh, that’s a fine story!”</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ballaghlanagh was the name of an old Irish bard (by tradition),
whose ghost used to come the night before to people
who were to be killed fighting in battle on the morning: and as
a ghost offers the most convincing proof that the mortal it represents
is no longer living, the term <i>Ballaghlanagh</i>, came,
figuratively, to signify a “dead man.” I learnt this explanation
from the old colloughs, who all joined exactly in the same
tradition.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>We all conceived that Doctor Knaggs only intended
to <i>try</i> to bleed him; and with this impression
flocked round the body. Doctor Knaggs turned
<i>the corpse</i> on one side, took off the cravat, and the
neck appeared to have somewhat of a bluish look
on one side. “Now, gentlemen,” said he, “here’s
the spot (pressing it with his finger): the spinal
marrow is injured, perhaps in more places than
one, or two either; the bones are dislocated, and
the gristle between them is knocked out of its
place. The formation of a gentleman’s neck is
just the same as that of a horse’s tail; and as most
of you have either yourselves docked and nicked,
or been present at the docking and nicking of the
tail of a hunter, you’ll understand precisely the
structure of Sam Doxy’s vertebre. Now, gentlemen,
(all this time placing Sam’s head in a convenient
position to make an incision, or, had the
coroner been present, to <i>cut the head off</i>, for clearer
demonstration,) see, now, I’ll just make a slight
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>longitudinal gash along the back joints of the neck,
and by withdrawing the skin and the covering of
fat on either side, I’ll show as clear as his nose the
fatal fracture of the spinal cord.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Every person in company now began instinctively
to feel the nape of his own neck for the
spinal cord which the doctor was speaking of.
“No man,” resumed Doctor Knaggs, “ever recovered
when this cord was fairly cracked, and
that’s the real secret of hanging, I assure you; and
it has been remarked that no culprit at Maryborough
has ever given a kick after he was duly
strung and the shelf fell, for these three last years,
since I humanely taught the hangman the proper
way. The <i>jerk</i> is the thing, gentlemen; and whether
the spine is broken by its being pulled up from
a man’s shoulders by a cord, or thrust down into
his shoulders by a fall on the head, makes no sort of
difference. Not dead!” resumed he, with a sneer
at the lieutenant: “Gentlemen, (every body came
close) now, you see, the gristle which we call
cartilage lies between those two bones, and the
cord runs over and within also:—when cut through,
then, the head, gentlemen, having no support, bobs
forward, and the dislocation will appear quite
plain. See, now,” and as he spoke he gave a
pretty smart gash from the nape of Sam’s neck
downward toward his shoulders; and proceeding
to draw back the skin and fat on each side, to get
a view of the bones, to the surprise of the turnpike-board,
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>the amazement of Doctor Knaggs himself,
and the triumph of Lieutenant Jer Palmer,
a stream of warm red blood instantly issued from
the gash, and a motion appeared in one eyelid of
the corpse.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By J—s!” shouted the lieutenant, “I told
you the man was not dead—not a taste of it. Oh!
you diabolical pothecary, if you attempt to give
another slash, I’ll cut your own wezand; and if
the poor follow dies <i>now</i>, of this cutting, which I
think he may, I’ll prosecute you for the murder of
Sam Doxy of the Derrys—a fair honest man, and
a friend of my father’s!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Doctor Knaggs stood petrified and motionless.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gentlemen,” continued Jer Palmer, “lend
me your cravats. (An immense jug of hot punch
was smoking on the hearth ready made for the
proposed dinner.) I know well enough what to
do,” said the lieutenant:  “my father’s own neck
was broken two years ago, coming home drunk one
night from Ballyspellen Spa, at the widow Maher’s
house-warming: his horse tumbled over at the
Seven Sisters; but Dr. Jacob soon brought him to
again.—I recollect now all about it. Here, gentlemen,
stir, give me your <i>cravats</i>; you have no
<i>handkerchiefs</i> I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They all obeyed the lieutenant, who immediately
plunged the cravats into the hot punch, and
lapped one of them round the <i>dead man’s</i> neck,
then another over that, and another still, and kept
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>dropping the hot punch on them, whereat the blood
flowed freely. He then, putting his knees to the
dead man’s shoulder, gave his head two or three no
very gentle lugs, accompanying them in the manner
of a view holloa, with “Ough! Hurra!
Hurra! By J—s he’s alive and kicking! Oh! you
murdering thief of a pothecary, get off, or I’ll cut
your throat!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The poor apothecary stood motionless at the
window; for Palmer (whom, in his paroxysm,
he durst not go near) was between him and the
door; but he wished himself a hundred miles off.
The lieutenant then put a spoonful of the punch
into Sam Doxy’s mouth, and down it went, to
the surprise of the turnpike-board. In a short
time a glassful was patiently received the same
way. A groan and a heavy sigh now proved the
fallibility of Pothecary Knaggs; and the lieutenant’s
superior treatment was extolled by the whole
board. The dead man at length opened one eye,
then the other; in about half an hour he could
speak; and in the course of an hour more the
broken-necked Doxy was able to sit up. They
then got some mulled wine and spices for him,
and he was quite recovered, with the exception of
a pain in his head and neck; but he could bear no
motion, so they fixed him in an upright position
in an arm-chair, and Palmer remained with him
to perfect his miraculous cure. We dined in another
room.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>Mr. Flood and myself called on Doxy next day,
and brought him and Lieutenant Palmer home to
Roundwood; and poor Dr. Knaggs’ wanting to
cut off the head of Mr. Sam Doxy of the Derrys
became a standing jest, with a hundred embellishments,
till both have been forgotten. I know not
if Knaggs is living. Sam Doxy was at last choked
by the drumstick of a turkey sticking in his throat
whilst he was picking it.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>TRANSFUSION OF BLOOD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Irish on the continent—Slow travelling of remittances—Inconveniences thereof—Sir John Burke, of Glinsk—Reasonable points of curiosity—Prompt satisfaction—<i>Messieurs des Créanciers</i>—Sir John’s health declines—Given over by the faculty generally—Doctor T—’s perseverance—Its success—A game at cross purposes—Custodiums in Ireland—New mode of liquidating a debt—Galway gore—Receipt for ennobling the <i>bourgeois</i> of Paris—Sir John Burke’s marriage and visit to Rome—His return—Lady Burke—Glinsk Castle.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been generally observed, that our fellow-subjects
who sojourn long on the continent often
lose many of their national traits, and imbibe those
of other countries. The Irish, however, present
an exception to this rule. I have scarce ever met
a thorough-paced Irishman whose oddities totally
deserted him; the humorous idiom of his language,
and the rich flavour of his dialect, are intrinsic,
and adhere as steadily to his tongue as
<i>fancy</i> does to his brain, and eccentricity to his
actions.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>An Irishman is <i>toujours</i> an Irishman, and wheresoever
he “puts up” seldom fails to find one inveterate
enemy—“himself.” This observation is
not confined to the lower or middle classes of
Hibernians, but occasionally includes the superior
orders. Like the swine, when the demon got into
them, Irishmen on the continent keep frisking,
pirouetting, galloping, and puffing away, till they
lose their footing; and there is scarcely a more
entertaining spectacle than that afforded by the
schemes, devices, and humours of a true son of
Erin, under these circumstances.</p>

<p class='c004'>I was greatly amused by an incident which took
place at Paris some time since;—it possesses as
much of the Irish <i>flavour</i> as any bagatelle anecdote
I recollect to have met with; and as the parties
are above the medium class, well known, all alive,
and still on the same <i>pavé</i> in perfect harmony, the
thing is rendered more entertaining.</p>

<p class='c004'>An Irish baronet of very ancient family (an
honour which he never suffered any person to be
ignorant of after twenty minutes’ conversation),
proprietor of a large Galway territory, garnished
with the usual dilapidated chateau, brogueless
tenantry, managing attorneys, and mis-managing
agents, having sufficiently squeezed his estate to
get (as he terms) the <i>juice</i> out of it, determined to
serve a few campaigns about St. James’ Street,
&amp;c., and try if he could <i>retrench</i> at the several
club-houses and “hells” to be met with amidst
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>what is called “high life” in our economical metropolis.</p>

<p class='c004'>After having enacted with <i>éclat</i> all the parts in
the various scenes usually performed on that great
theatre, he at length found, that the place was
not much <i>cheaper</i> than <i>sweet</i> Glinsk, or any old
principality of his own dear country. He therefore
resolved to change the scene for a more
diverting and cheerful one; and by way of a
<i>finish</i>, came over to Paris, where any species of
ruin may be completed with a taste, ease, and despatch
unknown in our boorish country.</p>

<p class='c004'>The baronet brought over three or four thousand
pounds in his fob, just (as he told me) to try,
by way of comparison, how long that quantity of
<i>the dross</i> would last in Paris<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a>—on which point his
curiosity was promptly satisfied:—“Frascati” and
the “Salon des Etrangers,” by a due application
of spotted bones, coloured pasteboard, and painted
whirligigs, under the superintendence of the Marquis
de Livere, informed him at the termination
of a short novitiate, that nearly the last of his
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>“Empereurs” had been securely vested in the
custody of the said Marquis de Livere.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Last year, the son of a very great man in England came
over to Paris with a considerable sum in his pocket for the very
same purpose. The first thing he did was gravely to ask his
banker (an excellent and sensible man), “How long six thousand
pounds would last him in Paris?” The reply was a true
and correct one, “If you play, three days; if you don’t, six
weeks.”</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Though this seemed, <i>primâ facie</i>, rather <i>inconvenient</i>,
yet the baronet’s dashing establishment
did not immediately suffer diminution, until his
valet’s repeated answer, <i>pas chez lui</i>, began to
alarm the crew of grooms, goddesses, led captains,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c004'>Misfortune (and he began to fancy this was very
like one) seldom delays long to fill up the place of
ready money when that quits a gentleman’s service:
and it now seemed disposed to attach itself to the
baronet in another way. Madam Pandora’s box
appeared to fly open, and a host of bodily ills beset
Sir John, who, having but indifferent nerves, was
quite thrown on his back.</p>

<p class='c004'>Such was the hapless situation of Sir John
Burke, while exercising his portion of the virtue
of patience, in <i>waiting for remittances</i>—a period
of suspense particularly disagreeable to travellers
abroad—every post-day being pretty certain to
carry off the <i>appetite</i>; which circumstance, to be
sure, may be sometimes considered <i>convenient</i>
enough.</p>

<p class='c004'>Families from the interior of Hibernia are peculiarly
subject to that suspense; and where their
Irish agent happens to be an old <i>confidential solicitor</i>,
or a <i>very dear friend</i>, or a near relation of the <i>family</i>,
the attack is frequently acute. An instance, indeed,
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>occurred lately, wherein the <i>miscarriage</i> of
an Irish letter actually caused the very same accident
to a new-married lady!</p>

<p class='c004'>The baronet, however, bore up well; and being
extremely good-humoured, the surliest <i>créanciers</i>
in Paris could not find in their hearts for some
time to be angry with him; and so, most unreasonably
left him to be angry with himself, which is a
thousand times more tormenting to a man, because
<i>sans</i> intermission.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length, some of his most <i>pressing</i> friends, who
a short time before had considered it their highest
honour to enjoy the <i>pratique</i> of Monsieur le Chevalier,
began to show symptoms of losing temper;—as
smoke generally forebodes the generation of
fire, something like a blaze seemed likely to burst
forth; and as the baronet most emphatically said
to me—“The d—d duns, like a flock of jack
snipes, were eternally thrusting their <i>long bills</i> into
me, as if I was a piece of <i>bog</i>!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Complaisance and smooth words very rarely
fail to conciliate a Frenchman; and, after all, the
baronet never experienced more civil or kinder
friends in Paris than some of these very <i>snipes</i>
who stuck their long bills into him. But “remittances”
from the county of Galway have been,
time immemorial, celebrated for the extreme slowness
of their movements; and though in general
very <i>light</i>, they travel more deliberately than a
broad-wheel waggon. Hence, Sir John Burke’s
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>“corporal ills” were both perpetuated and heightened
by his mental uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Doctors were called in, in hopes that one or
other of them might <i>by chance</i> hit upon a remedy;
and Sir John submitted to their prescriptions (to
use his own words), like a lamb going to the
slaughter.—“I knew very well,” said he, “that
one <i>banker</i> could do me more good by a single
dose, than all the <i>doctors</i> in Paris put together;—but
as my friends Messrs. * * * * * had declined to
administer any more <i>metallic</i> prescriptions, I really
feared that my <i>catastrophe</i> was not very distant.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And, indeed, the doctors, neither jointly nor
severally agreeing as to the nature of his symptoms,
nor to the necessary mode of treatment, after
several <i>consultations</i> respecting the <i>weather</i> and the
<i>war</i> (as customary), gave Sir John’s case up as
desperate: and having showed the palms of their
hands without any favourable result, shook their
heads, made each three low and lingering bows,
and left the baronet to settle affairs himself with
Madam Pandora as well as he could.</p>

<p class='c004'>One of these medical gentlemen, however,—a
fair, square, straightforward, skilful nosologist,—could
not bring himself so easily to give up the
baronet: he returned; and by dint of medicamenta,
phlebotomy, blistering, leeching, cupping,
smothering in vapour, &amp;c. &amp;c. (the pains of the
patient’s mind, meanwhile, being overcome by the
pains of his body) the doctor at last got him
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span><i>thorough the thing</i> (as they say in Ireland). He
was not, however, quite free from the danger of a
relapse; and an unlucky flask <i>extraordinary</i> of
“Epernay sec” (taken to celebrate his recovery)
set Sir John’s solids and fluids again fermenting,
knocked down his convalescence, which Dr. T——
had so indefatigably re-established, and introduced
a certain inflammatory gentleman called
fever.</p>

<p class='c004'>The clergy were now summoned, and attended
with an extra quantity of oil and water to lighten
and prepare the baronet’s soul for speedy transportation;
some souls, they said, and I believe truly,
being much easier put into dying order than others.
The skill of Doctor T——, however, once more
preserved his patient for further adventures, and
both physician and baronet agreed that, as the
priests had done his body none, and his soul no
<i>perceptible</i> service, and as holy men were of course
above all lust of lucre, there was no necessity for
cashing <i>them</i>; so that the contemplated fees for
masses should in strict justice be transferred to
prescriptions. A few more plenteous bleedings
were therefore substituted for extreme unction:
with the aid of a sound natural constitution, Sir
John once more found himself on his legs; and
having but little flesh, and no fat, his shanks had
not much difficulty in carrying his body moderate
distances.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the last bleeding, the incident occurred to
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>which the foregoing is but matter of induction.
The blood which the doctor had just extracted
from the baronet was about twenty ounces of
genuine ruby Galway gore, discharged unadulterated
from the veins of a high-crested, aboriginal
Irishman. It lay proudly basking and coagulating
before the sun in china basins, at the chamber-window.
Sir John seeming still rather weak, the
physician determined to bring all his skill into a
focus, discover the latent source of indisposition,
and if possible at once root it out of the baronet’s
constitution, thereby gaining the double advantage
of increasing professional fame and the amount of
his fees. Now, at precisely the same point of
time, the baronet was inventing an apology for <i>not
paying</i> the doctor.</p>

<p class='c004'>After musing some time, as every physician in
the world does, whether he is thinking of the
patient or not, Doctor T—— said, “Pray, let me
see your tongue, Sir John.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My <i>tongue</i>!” exclaimed the baronet, “ah!
you might be greatly disappointed by <i>that</i> organ;
there’s no depending on <i>tongues</i> now-a-days, doctor!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yet the tongue is very symptomatic, I can
assure you, Sir John,” pursued the doctor gravely.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Possibly, in <i>your</i> part of the world,” replied
the baronet. “But I do assure you, we place
very little reliance on tongues in my country.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know best,” said the doctor coolly:
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>“then, pray let me feel your pulse, Sir John,”
looking steadfastly on his stop-watch, counting the
seconds and the throbs of the Milesian artery.
“Heyday! why, your pulse is not only irregular,
but <i>intermits</i>!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish my remittances did not,” remarked
Sir John, mournfully, and thinking he had got an
excellent opportunity of apologising to the doctor.</p>

<p class='c004'>The latter, however, had no idea of any roundabout
<i>apologies</i> (never having been in Ireland), and
resumed: “your remittances! ah, ah, Sir John!
But seriously, your pulse is all astray; pray, do
you feel a pain any where?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, doctor,” said Sir John, (sticking in like
manner to <i>his</i> point,) “whenever I put my hand
into my breeches-pocket, I feel a confounded
twitch, which gives me very considerable uneasiness,
I assure you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hah!” said the doctor, conceiving he had now
discovered some new symptom about the femoral
artery—“are you sure there’s nothing <i>in</i> your
pocket that hurts you, Sir John?—Perhaps some—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“O no, doctor,” said the baronet rather impatiently;
“there’s <i>nothing at all</i> in my pocket,
Doctor T——.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then the twitch may be rather serious,” and
the doctor looked <i>knowing</i>, although he was still
<i>at fault</i> concerning the <i>éclaircissement</i>. “It is a
singular symptom. Do you feel your head at all
heavy, Sir John—a sensation of weight?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>“Not at all,” replied the other:—“my head
is (except my <i>purse</i>) the lightest thing I possess
at present.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The disciple of Galen still supposed Sir John
was jesting as to his purse, inasmuch as the plum-coloured
vis-a-vis, with arms, crests, and mantlings
to match—with groom, geldings, and the
baronet’s white Arabian, still remained at the
Hotel de Wagram, Rue de la Paix.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ha! ha! Sir John,” cried he, “I am glad to
see you in such spirits.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nothing, however, either as to the malady or
the fees being fully explained, it at length flashed
across the doctor’s comprehension that the baronet
might <i>possibly</i> be in downright <i>earnest</i> as to his
<i>remittances</i>. Such a thought must, under the circumstances,
have a most disheartening effect on
the contour of any medical man in Europe. On
the first blush of this fatal suspicion the doctor’s
features began to droop—his eyebrows descended,
and a sort of <i>in utrumque paratus</i> look, that many
of my readers must have borne when expecting a
money letter, but not quite sure it may not be an
<i>apology</i>, overspread his countenance, while his
nasal muscles puckering up (as in the tic douloureux),
seemed to quaver between a smile and a
sardonic grin.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir John could scarcely contain himself at the
doctor’s ludicrous embarrassment. “By Jove,”
said he, “I am serious!”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>“Serious! as to what, Sir John?” stammered
the physician, getting out of conceit both with his
patient and himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The fact,” said Sir John, “is this: your long
and indefatigable attention merits all my confidence,
and you shall have it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Confidence!” exclaimed the doctor, bowing,
“you do me honour; but—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, doctor, I now tell you (<i>confidentially</i>) that
certain papers and matters called in Ireland <i>custodiums</i>,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
have bothered both me and my brother
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>Joseph, notwithstanding all his exertions for me
as agent, receiver, remitter, attorney, banker,
auditor, and arranger-general; which said custodiums
have given up all my lands, in spite of Joe,
to the king, as trustee for a set of horse-jockies,
Jews, mortgagees, gamblers, solicitors, and annuity-boys—who
have been tearing me to pieces
for twenty years past without my having the
slightest suspicion of their misdemeanors; and
now, doctor, they have finally, by divers law fictions,
got <i>his majesty</i> to patronise them.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A <i>custodium</i> is a law proceeding in Ireland, not practised
much any where else, and is vastly worse than even an “extent
in aid.” By one fiction the debtor is supposed to owe money
to the king:—by another “fiction,” the king demands his
money;—and the debtor, by a third “fiction,” is declared a
rebel, because he does not pay the king.—A commission of rebellion
then issues in the name of the king against the debtor;
and by a fourth “fiction,” he is declared an outlaw, and all his
estates are seized and sequestered to pay <i>his majesty</i>. A
receiver of every shilling belonging to the debtor is then appointed
by the king’s chief baron of the exchequer; every
tenant on the estates is served with the “fictions,” as well as
the landlord; and a <i>debt</i> of <i>one hundred pounds</i> has been frequently
ornamented with a bill of costs to the amount of <i>three
thousand</i> in the name of his majesty, who does not know the
least circumstance of the matter.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was scarcely a gentleman in the county of Galway,
formerly, but was as great an <i>outlaw</i> as Robin Hood; with
this difference, that Robin Hood might be <i>hanged</i>, and his
majesty could only <i>starve</i> the gentleman.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>“But, sir! sir!” interrupted the doctor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I assure you, however,” continued Sir John,
placidly, “that my brother Joe (whose Christian
name—between you and me, doctor—ought to
have been Ulick, after Ulick the Milesian, if my
mother had done him common justice at his
christening) is a long-headed fellow, and will
promptly bring those infernal custodium impostors
into proper order.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But, sir, sir!” repeated the doctor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One fellow,” pursued the baronet, “hearing
that Joe intended to <i>call him out</i> for laying on his
papers, has stopped all law proceedings already,
and made a proper apology. The very name of
Burke of Glinsk, doctor, is as sounding as <i>Waterloo</i>,
in the county of Galway.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pardon me, Sir John,” said Doctor T——,
“but what can all this have to do with—”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>“Never mind,” again interrupted the baronet,
catching hold of one of the doctor’s coat-buttons,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
“never mind; I give you my word, Joe is a steady,
good, clever fellow, and looks two ways at every
thing before he does it—I don’t allude to the cast
in his eye: a horse with a wall-eye, you know,
doctor, is the very lad for hard work!—ha! ha!
ha!”</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How admirably does Horace describe the grievance of a
<i>bore</i> catching hold of your button, and making the proprietor a
prisoner till his speech is expended. Doctor T—— told me
that the satire came into his head whilst Sir John had him in
hold, and that in his hurry to emancipate himself, he made a
large cut in a new surtout, and quite spoiled its beauty.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>The doctor could stand this no longer, and
said, “I know nothing about wall-eyed horses,
Sir John.”—Indeed, being now hopeless, he made
the second of the three bows he had determined
to depart with; but he found his button still in
custody between Sir John’s fingers, and was
necessitated to suspend his exit, or leave it behind
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A plan has occurred to me, doctor,” said the
baronet, thoughtfully, “which may not only liquidate
my just and honourable debt to you for attendance
and operations, but must, if you are as
skilful as I think you are, eventually realise you
a pretty fortune.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This in a moment changed the countenance of
the doctor, as a smouldering fire, when it gets a
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>blast of the bellows, instantly blazes up and
begins to generate its hydrogen. “And pray,
sir,” asked the impatient physician, “what plan
may this be? what new <i>bank</i> are you thinking
of?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“’Tis no <i>bank</i>,” said Sir John; “its a much
better thing than any bank, for the more you <i>draw</i>,
the richer you’ll be.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor’s eyelids opened wide; his eyebrows
became elevated, and he drew his ear close to the
proposer, that he might not lose a single word of
so precious an <i>exposé</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know,” said Sir John, “though you are
a Sarnion (Guernsey-man) by birth, you <i>must</i>
know, as <i>all the world</i> knows, that the name of the
Burkes or O’Bourkes (Irlandois), and their castle of
Glinsk, have been established and celebrated in
Ireland some dozen centuries.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have heard the name, sir,” said the doctor,
rather peevishly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Be assured ’tis the very first cognomen in Ireland,”
said Sir John.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Possibly,” said the doctor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nay, <i>positively</i>,” rejoined the baronet: “far
more ancient than the O’Neils, O’Briens, O’Flahertys,
who indeed are comparatively <i>moderns</i>. We
were native princes and kings several centuries
before even the term Anno <i>Domini</i> was used.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I will not dispute it, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nay, I can prove it. I had six and twenty
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>quarters on my shield without a blot upon either—save
by one marriage with a d—d <i>Bodkin</i> out of
the twelve tribes of Galway, about a hundred and
eighty years ago. We never got over that!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For Heaven’s sake, sir,” said Doctor T——,
“do come to the point.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pardon me,” said Sir John, “I am on the
point itself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As how?” inquired the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come here,” said Sir John, “and I will soon
satisfy you on that head:” and as he spoke he led
him to the window, where three china cups full
of the baronet’s gore lay in regular order. “See!
that’s the genuine crimson stuff for you, doctor!
eighteen ounces at least of it; the richest in Europe!
and as to colour—what’s carmine to it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor was bewildered; but so passive, he
stood quite motionless.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now,” continued Sir John, “we are bringing
the matter to the point. You can <i>guarantee</i> this
gore to be genuine Glinsk blood: it gushed beautifully
after your lancet, doctor, eh! didn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What of that, sir?” said Doctor T——: “really,
Sir John, I can stay no longer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have much ordinary professional practice,”
said the baronet—“I mean exclusive of your
noble patients in Rue Rivoli, &amp;c.—visits, for instance,
to the Boulevard St. Martin, St. Antoine,
Place de Bastile, De Bourse, &amp;c., which you
know are principally peopled by brokers with
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>aspiring families; rich <i>négocians</i>, with ambitious
daughters, &amp;c., who, if they were to give five
hundred thousand francs, can’t get into one fashionable
<i>soirée</i> for want of a touch of gentility—not
even within smell of sweet little Berry’s<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> under
nursery-maids. Now,” said Sir John, pausing a
moment, “we’re at the point.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sir John is the greatest eulogist of the Duchess of Berry,
and has got the Legion of Honour for having given up his bed,
blankets, and all, to the Duke of Berry, somewhere on the
road, when they were both running away from Napoleon
Bonaparte.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>“So much the better,” said the man of medicine.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I understand that there is a member of the
faculty in Paris, who undertakes the <i>transfusion of
blood</i> with miraculous success, and has not only
demonstrated its practicability, but insists that it
may by improvement be rendered sufficiently operative
to harmonise and amalgamate the different
qualities of different species of animals. I am told
he does not yet despair of seeing, by <i>transfusion
of blood</i>, horses becoming the best mousers, cats
setting partridges, and the vulgarest fellows upon
earth metamorphosed into gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pshaw! pshaw!” exclaimed Doctor T——.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, I perceive no reason,” resumed Sir John,
“why any man should perform such an operation
better than yourself: and if you advertise in the <i>Petit
Avis</i> that you have a quantity of genuine Glinsk
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>O’Bourke <i>gore</i> always at command, to transfuse
into persons who wish to acquire the <i>gentilities</i> and
the feelings of noblesse, without pain or patent,
my blood, fresh from the veins, would bring you
at least a <i>Nap</i> a spoonful: and in particular proportions,
would so refine and purify the vulgar
puddle of the <i>bourgeois</i>, that they might soon be
regarded (in conjunction with their money) as high
at least as the half-starved <i>quatrième</i> nobility, who
hobble down to their sugar and water at <i>soirées</i>
in the fauxbourg St. Germain, and go to bed in
the dark to save candle-light.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor felt hurt beyond all endurance: he
blushed up to his very whiskers, sealed his lips hermetically—by
a sardonic smile only disclosing one
of his dog-teeth, and endeavoured to depart: but
the button was still fast between Sir John’s fingers,
who begged of his victim not to spare his veins,
saying, “that he would with pleasure stand as
much phlebotomy as would make a fortune for any
reasonable practitioner.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This was decisive: the doctor could stand it no
longer; so snatching up the toilet scissors, he cut
the button clean off his new surtout, and vanished
without waiting ceremoniously to make the third
bow, as had always previously been his custom.</p>

<p class='c004'>However, the baronet, when Joe (who should
have been Ulick) afterward sent him over some of
the <i>dross</i>, made full metallic compensation to the
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>doctor,—and within this last month I met them
walking together in great harmony.</p>

<p class='c004'>This incident, which I had known and noted
long before, was then repeated by Sir John in the
doctor’s presence; and it affords the very strongest
proof what a truly valuable liquid genuine Irish
gore is considered by the chiefs of County Galway.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is not a baronet in the United Kingdom
who (with the very essence of good-humour) has
afforded a greater opportunity for notes and anecdotes
than Sir John Burke of Glinsk Castle and
tilt-yard;—and no person ever will, or ever can,
relate them so well as himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir John Burke is married to the sister of Mr.
Ball, the present proprietor of Oatlands, commonly
called the <i>Golden Ball</i>. I witnessed the courtship;
negotiated with the brother; read over the
skeleton of the marriage settlement, and was present
at the departure of the baronet and his new
lady for Rome, to kiss the pope’s toe. I also had
the pleasure of hailing them on their return, as
<i>le Marquis</i> and <i>la Marquise de Bourke</i> of the Holy
Roman Empire. Sir John had the <i>promise</i> of a
<i>principality</i> from the papal see when he should be
prepared to pay his holiness the regulation price
for it. At all events, he came back highly freighted
with a papal bull, a nobleman’s patent, holy
relics, mock cameos, real lava, wax tapers, Roman
paving-stones, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and after having been overset
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>into the Po, and making the fortune of his
courier, he returned in a few months to Paris, to
ascertain what fortune his wife had;—a circumstance
which his anxiety to be married and kiss
the pope’s toe had not given him sufficient time
to investigate before. He found it very large, and
calculated to bear a good deal of cutting and
hacking ere it should quit his service—with no
great probability of his ever coaxing it back again.
Sir John’s good temper, however, settles that matter
with great facility by quoting Dean Swift’s
admirable eulogium upon poverty:—“Money’s
the devil, and God keeps it from us,” said the
dean. If this be orthodox, there will be more
gentlemen’s souls saved in Ireland than in any
other part of his Britannic Majesty’s dominions.</p>

<p class='c004'>Previous to Sir John’s marriage, Miss Ball understood,
or rather had formed a conception, that
Glinsk Castle was placed in one of the most cultivated,
beautiful, and romantic districts of romantic
Ireland, in which happy island she had never been,
and I dare say never will be. Burke, who seldom
says any thing without laughing heartily at
his own remark, was questioned by her pretty
closely as to the beauty of the demesne, and the
architecture of the castle. “Now, Sir John,”
said she, “have you much dressed grounds upon
the demesne of Glinsk?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dressed, my love!” repeated Sir John,
“why, my whole estate has been nearly <i>dressed up</i>
these seven years past.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>“That’s very uncommon,” said Miss Ball;
“there must have been a great expenditure on
it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, very great,” replied the baronet, “very
great.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The castle,” said her future ladyship, “is, I
suppose, in good order?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It ought to be,” answered Sir John; “for
(searching his pockets) I got a bill from my brother
Joe of, I think, two hundred pounds, only for
nails, iron cramps, and holdfasts—for a single
winter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The queries of Miss Ball innocently proceeded,
and, I think, the replies were among the pleasantest
and most adroit I ever heard. The
lady seemed quite delighted, and nearly expressed
a wish to go down to the castle as soon as
possible. “As Sir John’s rents may not come in
instantly,” said she, “I have, I fancy, a few
thousand pounds in the bank just now, and that
may take us down and new-furnish, at least, a
wing of the castle!”</p>

<p class='c004'>This took poor Sir John dreadfully aback.
Glinsk was, he told me, actually in a tumbling
state. Not a gravel walk within twenty miles of
it: and as to timber, “How the devil,” said he,
“could I support both my trees and my establishment
at the same time?—Now,” he pursued,
“Barrington, my good friend, do just tell her
what I told you about my aunt Margaret’s ghost,
that looks out of the castle window on every anniversary
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>of her own death and birth-day, and on
other periodical occasions. She’ll be so frightened
(for, thank God! she’s afraid of ghosts), that she’ll
no more think of going to Glinsk than to America.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tell her yourself, Sir John,” said I:—“nobody
understands a romance better; and I’m
sure, if this be not a <i>meritorious</i>, it is certainly an
<i>innocent</i> one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In fine, he got his groom to tell her maid all
about <i>the ghost</i>: the maid told the mistress, with
frightful exaggerations: Sir John, when appealed
to, spoke mysteriously of the matter; and the
purchase of Glinsk Castle could not have induced
Miss Ball to put her foot in it afterwards. She is
a particularly mild and gentlewomanly lady, and,
I fancy, would scarcely have survived a visit to
Glinsk, even if the ghost of Madam Margaret had
not prevented her making the experiment.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>SWEARING NO VICE.</h2>

<p class='c011'>English slang contrasted with Irish imprecation—The chase of St. Chrysostom, and his rescue—Meet garnish for an Hibernian anecdote—Futile attempts at imitation by English dramatists, &amp;c.—Remarks of a puritan on the author and his book—A caution, and a shrewd way of observing it—Michael Heney, steward of the author’s father—His notions concerning swearing—Curious dialogue between him and the author—New mode of teaching children filial respect.</p>

<p class='c006'>Though I have more than ordinary cause to be
gratified by the reception the first two volumes of
this work so unexpectedly met with, and am extremely
grateful for that reception, yet I am well
aware that certain starched moralists may conceive,
and perhaps, <i>primâ facie</i>, with reason, that there is
too much “imprecation,” and what the fastidious of
Bond-street call <i>vulgarity</i> introduced into the Irish
colloquies. I admit that a person who has never
been in the interior of Ireland, or accustomed to
the Irish people and their peculiarities, might
naturally think so. I therefore feel it a duty to
such critics, to give them at least one or two reasons
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>why they should not consider Irish oaths immoral,
or Irish colloquy vulgar.</p>

<p class='c004'>The outrageous blasphemy and indecency, so
copious in the <i>slang</i> of England, with neither
wit, point, or national humour, to qualify it,
might indeed disgust even the seven hundred
imps whom the devil sent into this world to
capture St. Chrysostom.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> The curses and imprecations
of Ireland are of a nature totally different.
They have no great variety; they are neither
premeditated, nor acquired through habits of
dissipation. They are idiomatic, a part and parcel
of the regular language of the country, and
repeated in other countries as a necessary appendage
to the humour of an Irish story, though they
would be utterly unadapted to any other people.
Walter Scott’s delightful writings, with all the
native simplicity and idiomatic dialect of the ancient
Celtic, would be totally spoiled, for instance,
had he mingled or introduced in them the oaths
and idioms indispensable as a seasoning to Irish
colloquy; an observation sufficiently illustrated by
the absurd and stupid attempts to imitate Irish
phraseology made by English dramatic mimics and
grimacers.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r13'>13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is a manuscript of great antiquity in the library of
the Vatican, which gives a full and circumstantial account of
the chase and running down of St. Chrysostom by a legion of
devils, and of his recapture by an inconsiderable number of
saints, who came from heaven to the rescue.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>Here I am quite prepared for the most severe
criticism. “Upon my word (the lank-haired
puritan will say), this is a most dangerous and
sinful writer; holding out that an anecdote, if it
be Irish, would lose its relish if there were neither
oaths nor imprecations tacked to it. No man can,
in the opinion of that immoral writer, repeat an
innocent Irish story, unless he at the same time
calls down the wrath of Heaven upon himself;
and, moreover, upon such of his auditors as take
any pleasure in hearing him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I know two very young ladies who told me that
their mammas directed them to skim over any <i>improper</i>
parts of the Sketches;—and that they read
every word, to <i>find out</i> those improper parts. The
book, they said, was extremely diverting; and as
to the oaths, they never swore themselves, and
never would, and therefore reading <i>that part</i> could
do them no harm.</p>

<p class='c004'>My own notions respecting this Irish habit of
imprecation were illustrated many years ago by an
actual dialogue with a man of low rank in that
country; and as our conversation bore upon a subject
of which scarce a day passes without reminding
me, I have retained its import as if it had
taken place yesterday: and though, after an interval
of more than forty-five years, it is not to be
expected I should repeat the exact <i>words</i> uttered,
yet I really think my memory serves as to the
precise <i>sentences</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>We had got accidentally upon the topic; and I
expressed my opinion, as I have already stated it
here, that these objectionable phrases were merely
idiomatic and involuntary—betraying no radical
or intentional vice. His notion went further; he
apologised for the practice not only statistically,
but said, with characteristic fervour, that the
genuine Irish people could not “do without it.”
“Many,” said he, “would not mind what was said
to them, unless there was a curse tacked on to
the direction. For instance, old Ned Doran, of
Cherry Hill, ordered all his children, male and
female, neither to curse nor swear, as they regarded
their father’s orders; and the consequence
was, the people all said they were going to turn
<i>swadlers</i>, and not a maid or a labourer would do a
farthing’s worth of work—for want of being <i>forced</i>
to do it in the ‘owld way.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man I talked with was a character not very
general in England, but frequently met with among
the Irish commonalty, whose acuteness of intellect,
naturally exceeding that of English labourers, is
rather increased by the simplicity of their ideas.
Self-taught, they turn any thing they learn to all
the purposes that their humble and depressed
state can give room for.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fortune had denied him the means of emerging
from obscurity; and Michael Heney was for many
years the faithful steward of my father, living with
him to the period of his death. His station in life
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>had been previously very low; his education was
correspondent; but he had from Nature a degree
of mental strength which operated in possessing
him with a smattering of every thing likely or proper
to be understood by persons of his grade. He
was altogether a singularity, and would not give
up one iota of his opinions. To address him as a
casuist, was the greatest favour you could confer
on Mick Heney; and the originality of his ideas,
and promptitude of his replies, often amused me
extremely.</p>

<p class='c004'>But for the detail of our dialogue:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is it not extraordinary, Michael,” said I one
day (as a great number of labourers were making
up hay in one of the meadows, and Michael and
myself were seated on a heap of it), “that those
poor fellows can scarcely pronounce a sentence
without some oath to confirm, or some deity to
garnish it with?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Master Jonah, (he never said ‘please your
honour’ to any body but his master,) sure its
their <i>only</i> way of talking <i>English</i>. They can speak
very good <i>Irish</i> without either swearing or cursing,
because it’s their own tongue. Besides, all their
forefathers used to be cursing the English day and
night for many a hundred years; so that they
never used the Sassanagh tongue without mixing
curses along with it, and now it’s grown a custom,
and they say that the devil himself could not
break them of it—poor crethurs!”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>“I should think the devil won’t try, Mick
Heney.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s no joke, Master Jonah.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But,” said I, (desirous of drawing him out,)
“they never fail to take the name of J—s on every
silly occasion. Sure there’s no reason in <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, but there is, Master Jonah,” said Heney:
“in the owld time, when the English used to be
cutting and hacking, starving and burning the poor
Irish, and taking all their lands, cattle and goods
from them, the crethurs were always praying to
Jesus and his holy Mother to save them from the
Sassanaghs: and so, praying to Jesus grew so <i>pat</i>,
that now they can’t help it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But then, Michael,” said I, “the commandments!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Poo-o! what have the crethurs to do with the
commandments? Sure it’s the Jews, and not the
poor Catholics, that have to do with them: and
sure the parliament men make many a law twice
as strong as any commandments; and the very
gentlemen that made those said laws don’t observe
their own enactments, except it suits their own
purposes—though every ’sizes some of the <i>crethurs</i>
are hanged for breaking one or two of them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Heney was now waxing warm on the subject,
and I followed him up as well as I could. “Why,
Mick, I wonder, nevertheless, that your clergy
don’t put a stop to the practice: perpetually calling
on the name of our Redeemer, without
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>any substantial reason for so doing, is certainly
bad.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what better name could they call on,
Master Jonah?” said Heney. “Why should the
clergy hinder them? It’s only putting them in
mind of the name they are to be saved by. Sure
there’s no other name could do them a pennyworth
of good or grace. It’s well for the crethurs they
have that same name to use. As father Doran
says, pronouncing the glorified name puts them in
mind every minute of the only friend any poor
Irish boy can depend upon; and there can be no
sin in reminding one of the place we must all go
to, and the Holy Judge we’ll be all judged by at
the latter end. Sure it’s not Sergeant Towler,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
or the likes of him, you’d have the crethurs
swearing by, Master Jonah. He makes them remember
<i>him</i> plentifully when he comes to these
parts.”</p>

</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>“And even the schoolmasters don’t punish
young children for the same thing,” remarked I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why should they?” rejoined Michael Heney.
“Sure Mr. Beal, though he’s a Protestant, does
not forbid it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How so?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, because he says if he did, it would encourage
disobedience to their parents, which is by
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>all clergy forbidden as a great sin as well as
shame.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Disobedience!” said I, in wonder.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; the fathers and mothers of the <i>childer</i>
generally curse and swear their own full share
every day, at any rate: and if the master told the
childer it was a great sin, they would consider
their fathers and mothers wicked people, and so
despise and fly in their faces!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But, surely you are ordered not to take God’s
name in vain?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And sure,” said Heney, “its <i>not</i> in vain when
it makes people believe the truth; and many
would not believe a word a man said in this country
unless he swore to it, Master Jonah.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But cursing,” persisted I, “is ill-natured as
well as wicked.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure there’s no harm in cursing a <i>brute beast</i>,”
said Heney, “because there’s no soul in <i>it</i>; and
if one curses a <i>Christian</i> for doing a bad act, sure
its only telling him what he’ll get a taste of on the
day of judgment.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Or, perhaps, <i>the day after</i>, Michael Heney,”
said I, laughing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The devil a priest in the county can tell that,”
said Heney; “but, (looking at his watch,)
you’re playing your <i>pranks</i> on me, Master Jonah!
the bells should have been rung for the
mowers’ dinner half an hour ago, and be d—d to
them! The devil sweep them altogether, the idle
crethurs!”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>“Fie to yourself, Mr. Heney!” cried I: but he
waited for no further argument, and I got out, I
really think, the reasons which they all believe
justify the practice. The French law makes an
abatement of fifteen years out of twenty at the
gallies, if a man kills another without premeditation:
and I think the same principle may apply
to the involuntary assemblage of oaths which, it
should seem, have been indigenous in Ireland for
some centuries past.</p>

Mr. Thomas’s—The author among the guests, in company with John Philpot Curran—General punctuality of the latter at dinner-time—His mysterious non-appearance—Speculations and reports—Diver, from Newfoundland—His simultaneous absence—The house searched—Discovery of a ghost, and its metamorphosis into Curran—A curious blockade—Its relief, and accompanying circumstances—Comments of the author.</p>

<p class='c006'>The late Mr. Curran was certainly one of the
most distinguished of Irishmen, not only in wit
and eloquence, but in eccentricity: of this quality
in him, one or two traits have been presented to
the reader in the former part of this work; and
the following incident will still further illustrate it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Reverend Mr. Thomas, whose <i>sobriquet</i> in
his neighbourhood was “Long Thomas,” he being
nearly six feet and a half high, resided near Carlow,
and once invited Curran and myself to spend
a day and sleep at his house on our return from
the assizes. We accepted the invitation with pleasure,
as he was an old college companion of mine—a
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>joyous, good-natured, hospitable, hard-going divine
as any in his county.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Reverend Jack Read, a three-bottle parson
of Carlow, with several other jolly neighbours,
were invited to meet us, and to be treated with
the wit and pleasantry of the celebrated Counsellor
Curran, who was often extremely fond of shining
in that class of society.</p>

<p class='c004'>We all arrived in due time;—dinner was appointed
for five <i>precisely</i>, as Curran always stipulated
(wherever he could make so free) for the
punctuality of the dinner-bell to a single minute.
The very best cheer was provided by our host: at
the proper time, the dishes lay basking before the
fire, in readiness to receive the several provisions
all smoking for the counsellor, &amp;c. The clock,
which, to render the cook more punctual, had been
that very noon regulated by the sundial, did not
on its part vary one second. Its hammer and bell
melodiously sounded <i>five</i>, and announced the
happy signal for the banquet. All the guests
assembled in the dining-room, which was, in honest
Thomas’s house, that apartment which the fine
people of our day would call a drawing-room—the
latter being then by no means regarded as indispensable
in the dwelling-house of a moderate gentlemen.
The family parlour, in fact, answered its
purpose mighty well.</p>

<p class='c004'>Every guest of the reverend host having now
decided on his chair, and turned down his plate,
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>in order to be as near as possible to Counsellor
Curran, proceeded to whet his knife against the
edge of his neighbour’s, to give it a due keenness
for the most tempting side of the luscious sirloin,
which by anticipation frizzed upon its pewter dish.
Veal, mutton, turkey, ham, duck, and partridge,
all “piping hot,” were ready and willing to leap
from their pots and spits into their respective
dishes, and to take a warm bath each in its proper
gravy. The cork-screw was busily employed:
the wine-decanters ornamented the four corners of
the well-dressed table, and the punch, jugged, and
bubbling hot upon the hearth-stone, perfumed the
whole room with its aromatic potsheen odour.</p>

<p class='c004'>Every thing bespoke a most joyous and protracted
banquet;—but, meanwhile, where was the
great object of the feast?—the wheedler of the
petty juries, and the admonisher of the grand ones?
Where was the great orator, in consequence of
whose brilliant reputation such a company was
collected? The fifth hour had long passed, and
impatience became visible on every countenance.
Each guest, who had a watch, gave his fob no
tranquillity, and never were timekeepers kept on
harder duty. The first half-hour surprised the
company; the next quarter <i>astonished</i>, and the
last <i>alarmed</i> it. The clock, by <i>six</i> solemn notes,
set the whole party surmising, and the host appeared
nearly in a state of stupefaction. Day had
departed, and twilight was rapidly following its
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>example, yet no tidings of the orator: never had
the like been known with regard to Curran—punctuality
at dinner being a portion of his very nature.
There are not more days in a leap year than there
were different conjectures broached as to the cause
of my friend’s non-appearance. The people about
the house were sent out on the several roads to
reconnoitre. He had been seen, certainly, in the
garden at four o’clock, but never after;—yet
every now and then a message came in to announce,
that “an old man had seen <i>a counsellor</i>,
as he verily believed, walking very quick on the
road to Carlow.” Another reported that “a woman
who was driving home her cow met one of
the counsellors going leisurely toward Athy, and
that he seemed very <i>melancholy</i>; that she had seen
him at the ’sizes that blessed morning, and the
people towld her it was the great law preacher
that was in it.” Another woman who was bringing
home some turf from the bog, declared before
the Virgin and all the Saints that she saw “a
little man in black with a stick in his hand going
toward the Barrow;” and a collough sitting at her
own cabin door feeding the <i>childer</i>, positively saw
a “black gentleman going down to the river, and
soon afterward heard a great splash of water at
the said river; whereupon, she went <i>hot-foot</i> to
her son, Ned Coyle, to send him thither to see if
the gentleman was in the water; but that Ned
said, sure enuff nothing natural would be after
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>going at that time of the deep dusk to the place
where poor Armstrong’s corpse lay the night he
was murthered; and he’d see all the gentlemen in
the county to the devil (God bless them!) before
he’d go to the said place till morning early.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The faithful clock now announced <i>seven</i>, and
the matter became too serious to admit of any
doubt as to poor Curran having met his catastrophe.
I was greatly shocked; our only conjectures
now being, not <i>whether</i>, but <i>how</i>, he had lost
his life. As Curran was known every day to strip
naked and wash himself all over with a sponge
and cold water, I conjectured, as most rational,
that he had, in lieu of his usual ablution, gone to
the Barrow to bathe before dinner, and thus unfortunately
perished. All agreed in my hypothesis,
and hooks and a draw-net were sent for immediately
to Carlow, to scour the river for his body.
Nobody, whatever might have been their feelings,
<i>said</i> a word about dinner. The beef, mutton, and
veal, as if in grief, had either turned into broth, or
dropped piecemeal from the spit; the poultry fell
from their strings, and were seen broiling in the
dripping-pan. The cook had forgotten her calling,
and gone off to make inquiries. The stable-boy
left his horses; indeed, all the domestics, with
one accord, dispersed with lanterns to search for
Counsellor Curran in the Barrow. The Irish cry
was let loose, and the neighbourhood soon collected;
and the good-natured parson, our host,
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>literally wept like an infant. I never saw so much
confusion at any <i>dinner-table</i>. Such of the guests
as were gifted by Nature with keen appetites,
suffered all the tortures of hunger, of which, nevertheless,
they could not in humanity complain; but
a stomachic sympathy of woe was very perceptible
in their lamentations for the untimely fate of
so great an orator.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was at length suggested by our reverend host
that his great Newfoundland dog, who was equally
sagacious, if not more so, with many of the parishioners,
and rivalled, in canine proportion, the
magnitude of his master, was not unlikely, by
diving in the Barrow, to discover where the body
lay deposited—and thus direct the efforts of the
nets and hookers from Carlow. This idea met
with universal approbation; and every body took
up his hat, to go down to the river. Mary, a
young damsel, the only domestic who remained
in the house, was ordered to call Diver, the dog;—but
Diver was absent, and did not obey the summons.
Every where resounded, “Diver! Diver!”
but in vain.</p>

<p class='c004'>New and multifarious conjectures now crossed
the minds of the different persons assembled:—the
mystery thickened: all the old speculations went
for nothing; it was clear that Curran and Diver
had absconded together.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length, a gentleman in company mentioned
the circumstance of a friend of his having been
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>drowned while bathing, whose dog never left his
clothes, on the bank, till discovered nearly dead
with hunger. The conjecture founded hereon was,
however, but momentary, since it soon appeared
that such <i>could not</i> be the case with Curran. I
knew that he both feared and hated big dogs;<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>besides, there was no <i>acquaintance</i> between him
and the one in question. Diver had never seen
the counsellor before that day, and therefore could
have no personal fondness for him, not to say, that
those animals have a sort of instinctive knowledge
as to who likes or dislikes them, and it was more
probable that Diver, if either, would be an enemy
instead of a friend to so great a stranger. But
the creature’s absence, at any rate, was unaccountable,
and the more so, inasmuch as he never before
had wandered from his master’s residence.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r15'>15</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Curran had told me, with infinite humour, of an adventure
between him and a mastiff when he was a boy. He had heard
somebody say, that any person throwing the skirts of his coat
over his head, stooping low, holding out his arms and creeping
along backward, might frighten the fiercest dog and put him to
flight. He accordingly made the attempt on a miller’s animal
in the neighbourhood, who <i>would never let</i> the boys <i>rob the
orchard</i>; but found to his sorrow that he had a dog to deal with
who did not care which end of a boy went foremost, so as he
could get a good bite out of it. “I pursued the instructions,”
said Curran; “and, as I had no eyes save those in front, fancied
the mastiff was in full retreat: but I was confoundedly mistaken;
for at the very moment I thought myself victorious, the
enemy attacked my rear, and having got a reasonably good
mouthful out of it, was fully prepared to take another before I
was rescued. Egad, I thought for a time the beast had devoured
my entire <i>centre of gravity</i>, and that I never should go
on a steady perpendicular again.” “Upon my word, Curran,”
said I, “the mastiff may have left you your <i>centre</i>, but he
could not have left much <i>gravity</i> behind him, among the bystanders.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I had never recollected this story until the affair of Diver at
Parson Thomas’s, and I told it that night to the country gentlemen
before Curran, and for a moment occasioned a hearty
laugh against him; but he soon <i>floored</i> me, in our social converse,
which whiled away as convivial an evening as I ever
experienced.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Mary, the maid, was now desired to search <i>all</i>
the rooms and offices for Diver, while we sat pensive
and starving in the parlour. We were
speedily alarmed by a loud shriek, immediately
after which Mary rushed tottering into the room,
just able to articulate:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“O, holy Virgin! holy Virgin! yes, gentlemen!
the counsellor <i>is</i> dead, sure enough. And
I’ll die too, gentlemen! I’ll never recover it!” and
she crossed herself twenty times over in the way
the priest had taught her.</p>

<p class='c004'>We all now flocked round, and asked her simultaneously
how she <i>knew</i> the counsellor was dead?</p>

<p class='c004'>Crossing herself again, “I saw his <i>ghost</i>, please
your reverence!” cried poor Mary, “and a frightful
ghost it was! just out of the river, and not even
<i>decent</i> itself. I’m willing to take my affidavy that
I saw his ghost, quite <i>indecent</i>, straight forenent
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>“Where? where?” cried every body, as if with
one breath.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the double-bedded room next your reverence’s,”
stammered the terrified girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>We waited for no more to satisfy us either that
she was mad, or that robbers were in the house:
each person seized something by way of a weapon:
one took a poker, another a candlestick, a third a
knife or fire-shovel, and up stairs we rushed.
Only one could go in, conveniently, abreast; and
I was among the first who entered. The candles
had been forgotten; but the moon was rising, and
we certainly saw what, in the opinion of some
present, corroborated the statement of Mary. Two
or three instantly drew back in horror, and attempted
to retreat, but others pressed behind; and
lights being at length produced, an exhibition far
more ludicrous than terrific presented itself. In a
far corner of the room stood, erect and formal, and
<i>stark naked</i> (as a <i>ghost</i> should be), John Philpot
Curran, one of his majesty’s counsel, learned in
the law,—trembling as if in the ague, and scarce
able to utter a syllable, through the combination
of cold and terror. Three or four paces in his
front lay Diver, from Newfoundland, stretching
out his immense shaggy carcase, his long
paws extended their full length, and his great
head lying on them with his nose pointed toward
<i>the ghost</i>, as true as the needle to the pole. His
hind legs were gathered up like those of a wild
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>beast ready to spring upon his prey. He took an
angry notice of the first of us that came near him,
growled, and seemed disposed to resent our intrusion;—but
the moment his master appeared, his
temper changed, he jumped up, wagged his tail,
licked the parson’s hand, cast a scowling look at
Curran, and then a wistful one at his master,—as
much as to say, “I have done my duty, now do
you yours:” he looked, indeed, as if he only
waited for the word of command, to seize the
counsellor by the throttle.</p>

<p class='c004'>A blanket was now considerately thrown over
Curran by one of the company, and he was <i>put to
bed</i> with half a dozen more blankets heaped upon
him: a tumbler of hot potsheen punch was administered,
and a second worked miracles: the natural
heat began to circulate, and he was in a
little time enabled to rise and tell us a story
which no hermit even telling his last beads could
avoid laughing at. Related by <i>any one</i>, it would
have been good; but as told by Curran, with his
powers of description and characteristic humour,
was superexcellent;—and we had to thank Diver,
the water-dog, for the highest zest of the whole
evening.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fact was, that a little while previous to
dinner-time, Curran, who had omitted his customary
ablution in the morning, went to our
allotted bed-chamber to perform that ceremony;
and having stripped, had just begun to apply the
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>sponge, when Diver, strolling about his master’s
premises to see if all was right, placed by chance
his paw against the door, which not being fastened,
it flew open, he entered unceremoniously,
and observing what he conceived to be an extraordinary
and suspicious figure, concluded it
was somebody with no very honest intention,
and stopped to reconnoitre. Curran, unaccustomed
to so strange a valet, retreated, while Diver
advanced, and very significantly showed an intention
to seize him by the naked throat; which
operation, if performed by Diver, whose tusks
were a full inch in length, would no doubt have
admitted an inconvenient quantity of atmospheric
air into his œsophagus. He therefore crept as
close into the corner as he could, and had the
equivocal satisfaction of seeing his adversary advance
and turn the meditated <i>assault</i> into a complete
<i>blockade</i>—stretching himself out, and “maintaining
his position” with scarcely the slightest
motion, till the counsellor was rescued, and the
siege raised.</p>

<p class='c004'>Curran had been in hopes that when Diver had
satisfied his <i>curiosity</i> he would retire; and with
this impression, spoke kindly to him, but was
answered only by a growl. If Curran repeated his
blandishments, Diver showed his long white tusks;—if
he moved his foot, the dog’s hind legs were in
motion. Once or twice Curran raised his hand:
but Diver, considering that as a sort of challenge,
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>rose instantly, and with a low growl looked significantly
at Curran’s windpipe. Curran, therefore,
stood like a <i>model</i>, if not much like a marble divinity.
In truth, though somewhat less comely, his
features were more expressive than those of the
Apollo Belvidere. Had the circumstance occurred
at Athens to Demosthenes, or in the days of Phidias,
it is probable my friend Curran, and Diver,
would have been at this moment exhibited in virgin
marble at Florence or at the Vatican;—and I
am quite sure the <i>subject</i> would have been better
and more amusing than that of “the dying gladiator.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>GEORGE ROBERT FITZGERALD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>George Robert Fitzgerald and Mr. Richard Martin, M. P. for Galway—The “Prime Sergeant,” Lord Altamont’s wolf-dog—Shot by Fitzgerald—The circumstance resented by Mr. Martin—The latter insulted by his antagonist in the Dublin Theatre—Mission of Mr. Lyster to George Robert, and its disastrous consequences—A legal inquiry and strange decision—Meeting between the principals—Fitzgerald receives two shots without injury—Explanation of that enigma.</p>

<p class='c006'>A very illustrative anecdote of the habits of
former times is afforded by the celebrated rencontre
between George Robert Fitzgerald of Turlow,
member for Mayo, and Mr. Richard Martin of
Connemara, member for Galway county, which
occurred nearly half a century ago. Both were
gentlemen of great public notoriety: both men of
family and of fortune. But of all the <i>contrasts</i> that
ever existed in human nature, theirs was in the
superlative degree; for modern biography does not
present a character more eminently vindictive and
sanguinary than the one, or an individual more
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>signalised by active humanity and benevolence than
the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the chief of Connemara I have now been
nearly forty years in a state of uninterrupted
friendship:—failings he has—“let him who is faultless
throw the first stone!” The character I
should give of him may be summed up in a single
sentence. “Urbanity toward women; benevolence
toward men; and humanity toward the brute
creation.” I must observe, however, that he is
one of those good fellows who would rather do any
body’s business than his own; and durst look any
thing in the face rather than his own situation.
As to his <i>charity</i>, I cannot say too much; as to his
<i>politics</i>, I cannot say too little.</p>

<p class='c004'>His unfortunate antagonist, Mr. Fitzgerald, has
long since met his miserable fate. Mr. Martin
still lives; and seems to defy, from the strength of
his constitution, both time and the destroyer. If
<i>ever</i> he should become defunct, there is not a bullock,
calf, goose, or hack, but ought to <i>go into deep
mourning</i> for him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The virulent animosity and unfinished conflicts
between these celebrated personages once formed
a subject of very general conversation. When
the bullets of holster pistols flatten against the
ribs of a gentleman, there can be no great use in
fighting any more with <i>him</i>: it is better to break
fresh ground with some more vulnerable amateur;
and as “fire eating” was at the period I allude to
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>in full taste and fashion, no person who felt a
<i>penchant</i> for chivalry need wait a single hour for a
thrust. Every gentleman then wore his sword or
<i>couteau de chasse</i>, which there could be no trouble
in drawing.</p>

<p class='c004'>I was quite unacquainted with the true state
of the quarrel between these parties, or the facts
of their rencontres; and have begged my friend
Martin to give me a circumstantial detail, lest I
might mistake and be called a “bouncer:” he
was so obliging as to comply; and I conceive that
his Ms. statement is so perspicuous and fair,
almost amounting to perfect impartiality—in that
conversational style, too, best calculated for narrative,—that
I determine to give it in nearly the
same words; and when it is combined with a few
facts which I learned from another friend, I venture
to think that a better outline of Mayo and
Galway lords, commoners, judges, country gentlemen,
and <i>fire eaters</i>, cannot be found. As, however,
there is nothing in it chivalrous in the <i>ladies’</i>
way—the whole being about <i>hate</i> with not one
particle respecting <i>love</i>, I fear it will not be a
favourite sketch with the gentler part of the creation.
To make them amends, I’ll search my old
trunks, and find if possible some pretty sketch that
has <i>nothing but love</i> or <i>marriage</i> in it, which they
shall have as well dressed and garnished as they
can reasonably expect from so old a <i>cuisinier</i>;
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>and now, with their kind permission, we will proceed
to County Mayo.</p>

<p class='c004'>“George Robert Fitzgerald, having a deadly
hate to all the Brown family, but hating most
Lord Altamont, rode up one morning from Turlow
to Westport House, and asked to see the big
wolf-dog called the ‘Prime Sergeant.’ When
the animal appeared, he instantly shot it, and desired
the servants to tell their master that ‘until
the noble peer became charitable to the wandering
poor whose broken meat was devoured by hungry
wolf-dogs, <i>he</i> would not allow any such to be
kept.’ He, however, left a note to say that he
<i>permitted</i> Lady Anne, Lady Elizabeth, and Lady
Charlotte Brown, each to keep one <i>lap-dog</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Proud of this exploit, he rode into Lord Sligo’s
town of Westport, and proclaimed in the marketplace
that he had just shot the <i>Prime Sergeant</i>
dead. The whole town was alarmed; an uproar
arose: but after some debate among the wisest or
rather the <i>stoutest</i> people in the town, whether
George Robert Fitzgerald ought not to be arrested
if possible for this deliberate murder of Counsellor
Brown; he quieted all by saying, ‘I have shot a
much worthier <i>animal</i>, the big watch-dog.’<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r16'>16</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Prime Sergeant of the Irish bar was then Lord Sligo’s
brother—a huge, fat, dull fellow; but the great <i>lawyer</i> of the
family. Prime Sergeant Brown was considered as an oracle by
the whole county of Mayo: yet there could scarcely be found
man less calculated to <i>tell fortunes</i>. The watch-dog was
named after him.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>“I was at this time much attached to the family;
and debating in my own mind how best to conduct
myself toward my friends, I determined not
to tell George Robert my opinion, as it would be
in effect to declare that Lord Altamont wanted courage
to defend his own honour. I therefore resolved
on seeking some more plausible ground of quarrel,
which soon presented itself; for at the summer
assizes of Mayo, holden at Castlebar, Charles
Lionel Fitzgerald prosecuted his elder brother
George Robert for false imprisonment and savage
conduct toward their father, upon whom George
Robert had fastened a chain and dray!</p>

<p class='c004'>“The affair came on before Lord Carleton, and
I volunteered in the only cause I ever pleaded.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r17'>17</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. Richard Martin had been called to the Irish bar, as
the eldest sons of the most respectable families of Ireland
then were, not, as might be supposed, to practise for others, but
with a supposition that they would thereby be better enabled to
defend their own <i>territories</i> from judgments, mortgagees, custodiums,
&amp;c. &amp;c., and to “stave off” vulgar demands, which if
too speedily conceded, might beget very serious inconveniences.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>“An affidavit was produced, stating that the
father was <i>not</i> confined. I observed, ‘that Robert
Fitzgerald had long notice of this cause coming
on; and that the best answer would be the
<i>attendance</i> of the father when he was called as one
of the magistrates in the commission for the county
of Mayo.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>“Remesius Lennon, a battered old counsellor,
on the other side, observed that the father was one
of the worst men living, and that it would be unjust
to censure any son for confining such a public
nuisance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I opposed putting off the trial of George
Robert, and concluded to this effect:—‘Though
believing that, in course of a long life, this wretched
father had committed many crimes, yet the greatest
crime against society and the greatest sin
against Heaven that he ever perpetrated, was the
having <i>begotten the traverser</i>.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“On this, George Robert said, smiling, ‘Martin,
you look very healthy—you take good care of
your <i>constitution</i>; but I tell you, that you have this
day taken very bad care of your <i>life</i>.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“The trial went on; and it was <i>proved</i>, among a
great number of other barbarities, that the father
<i>was</i> chained by his son George Robert to a dray,
and at times to a muzzled bear: a respectable jury
found the traverser guilty; and Lord Carleton sentenced
him to three years’ imprisonment, and to
pay a fine to the king of five hundred pounds.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Kissing’ at this time went ‘by favour;’ and
Mr. Conally, the brother-in-law of George Robert,
obtained from the late Duke of Buckingham, then
Lord Lieutenant, the pardon and release of Fitzgerald.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Some months after, I happened to pass through
Castlebar, and learned that Mr. Fitzgerald was in
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>the town. I had heard of his denunciations, but my
determination was, neither to <i>avoid</i> nor <i>seek</i> my
antagonist. Desirous of ascertaining what I had
to expect, I requested a friend to call on him, and,
after conversation on some ordinary subject, to say
that <i>I</i> had been in the town.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This was done, and George Robert answered,
‘that he hoped, whenever we met, it would not
be as <i>enemies</i>.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“My friend reported this: but, on the whole, I
thought it as well not to seek any occasion of meeting
a person who, I apprehended, might, so soon
after our dispute, be induced to depart from his
pacific resolution; I therefore proceeded on my
journey to Dublin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mrs. Crawford, I found, had been engaged to
play for a few nights at Crow Street theatre, and
I determined to see her <i>Belvidera</i>. I had not long
taken my seat in the front row of the stage-box,
when I heard a noisy, precipitate step, and an
order given in a commanding tone for the box to
be opened. I turned, and saw Mr. Fitzgerald,
who took his place on the next row. His look indicated
rage, and I therefore left my place in front,
and took my seat on the same row with him. He
stared for a moment or two directly into my face,
then turned away and laughed, on which I asked,
‘Have you any thing particular to say to <i>me</i>, Mr.
Fitzgerald?’</p>

<p class='c004'>“He answered, with a stern look of defiance—‘Only
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>to tell you that I followed you from Castlebar,
to proclaim you the <i>bully</i> of the Altamonts.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘You have said enough, Mr. Fitzgerald; you
no doubt expect to hear from me, and it shall be
early in the morning.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘<i>I</i> shall hear from <i>you</i> to-morrow!’ he repeated,
contemptuously, making, as he spoke, a blow
at me, and adding, ‘this will refresh your memory.’
He then pulled back his body from behind
the curtain of the box, and instantly retreated
toward the lobby.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My feet got entangled in the curtain when I
rushed out to follow my antagonist, and I fell upon
the floor. The present Lord Howden, then Major
Craddock, kindly lifted me up. When on my
feet, I sprang into the lobby, which was crowded
almost to an overflow. I uttered all that rage
could dictate, accused Fitzgerald of cowardice,
and told him he had created the present <i>scene</i> in
order that we should be both bound over to the
peace.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘You have got a blow,’ replied he: ‘I desire
to disgrace you, and when you are punished to my
liking <i>that</i> way (and not before) you shall have the
<i>satisfaction</i> of being shot, or run through the
body.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“Next day, I met the late Lord Donoughmore,
and he most kindly said, if I required it, he would
deliver a message to Fitzgerald. I said, ‘No, I
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>could not think of embroiling any friend of mine
with such a fellow; that I would wear my sword,
and trust to my opportunities of meeting Fitzgerald.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“I watched his house closely for several days,
but he did not appear. At this critical moment,
a Mr. George Lyster called upon me, and said he
would take my message to Fitzgerald.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I answered, ‘that of all things I most desired
to meet him; that I found I could not unkennel
the fox; and that I would thank whomsoever
should succeed in putting us face to face.’ I was,
however, cautious of employing Lyster, knowing
him to be Fitzgerald’s cousin, and supposing it
possible he might have been employed by Fitzgerald
himself: this induced me to try him and to
say, ‘As you have <i>offered</i> to go to this gentleman,
I will thank you to appoint the <i>earliest moment</i> for
a meeting.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Lyster drew not back, but went to his cousin’s
house, and was ushered by one of the servants
into the drawing-room. Mr. Fitzgerald shortly
entered, and as soon as Mr. Lyster hinted his
business, our hero desired the footman to send
one of the valets: when the latter entered, Fitzgerald
said, ‘Francis, bring my cudgel with the
green riband.’ When Fitzgerald got this weapon,
he addressed his relative thus—‘How dare you
bring a <i>message</i> to me? Hold out your finger
with the diamond-ring upon it!’ Poor Lyster
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>obeyed, ignorant of his design, and with one blow
Fitzgerald broke the finger, and the band of the
ring, which fell on the floor. ‘Now,’ proceeded
he, ‘I order you to take up the ring, and present
it to me.’ As if thunderstruck, Lyster obeyed.
When Fitzgerald got possession of the ring, he put
it into paper, and returned it to Lyster, saying,
‘Young fellow, take care of the ring! put it up
very safe, and don’t swear I robbed you of a present
from some fair one.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“This dialogue (recounted to me by Lyster
himself) was followed by several blows, which cut
and battered the young man severely. At last, he
rushed to the window, drove his head through a
pane of glass, and cried out for assistance. The
police, hearing the cry, soon assembled; and not
finding any of the city magistrates, they having
seized both parties, conducted them into the presence
of Mr. Justice Robinson.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The judge first heard Lyster, and seeing him
severely bruised, and supposing his skull might
be fractured, declared that the prisoner could not
be bailed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fitzgerald now, on the other hand, asked to
have his examination entered against Lyster. He
stated, ‘that Lyster was his relative, and protected
by him, and that I had <i>influenced</i> the young man
to deliver a message from me.’ He said, ‘that
Mr. Lyster <i>had</i> delivered such a <i>message</i>: that <i>he</i>
had answered mildly, that he would not fight Mr.
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>Martin;’ whereon, (says Fitzgerald,) this young
gentleman said, ‘Then you must fight <i>me</i>.’ My
answer was, that I would not fight <i>any man</i>; on
which,’ continued George Robert, ‘he made several
blows of the cudgel I hold in my hand’ (his own)
‘at me. I happened to be more dexterous than my
assailant, and was fortunate enough to take the
weapon out of his hands, and in my own defence
was obliged to strike in turn, or I should have
been murdered.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“The old judge, believing every word of so
plausible a statement, said, ‘I have heard enough;
I commit Lyster for trial, and bind over Mr. Fitzgerald
to prosecute; and I do so, expressing my
approbation of Mr. Fitzgerald’s manly conduct, in
refusing to fight Mr. Martin, and thus appealing
for redress to the laws of his country.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shortly after this curious scene, I heard that
Fitzgerald was at Castlebar, and had it intimated
to him that I should be there. I travelled
with Mr. H. Flood<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a> in his carriage, and he kindly
offered to be my friend, which I declined—fearing
to have exposed him to some insult.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r18'>18</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This was the celebrated Henry Flood, the antagonist of
Grattan—certainly the ablest statesman of his day. He had
himself fought more than once; and had killed Mr. Eager, the
father of Lord Clifden, of Gowran.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>“I had sent my duelling pistols by a fellow who
got drunk on the road, and forgot his errand;—so
that I remained some hours at Lord Lucan’s house,
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>expecting in vain their arrival, during which
period I heard that Mr. Fitzgerald was parading
the town with a number of persons from Turlow, his
own estate, famous for its mobs trained to every
kind of outrage.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> I heard, too, that he said, I
waited for Lord Altamont’s carriage, which, observed
he significantly, <i>would not arrive</i>. Here I
have to remark that I had written a note to Lord
Altamont, to say that I would gladly compound
for a slight wound in the expected affair, and that
I requested his carriage might be in waiting for
me at Castlebar, which is only eight miles from
Westport. George Robert had heard this, and
said to the mob, ‘Mr. Martin expects Altamont’s
carriage, but he may wait long enough; for though
the horse is a brave animal, I fancy Altamont’s
are like the owner, and will not stand the smell of
powder.’</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r19'>19</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These were the gentry by whom the author was some time
subsequently so closely beleaguered at the yarn fair at Castlebar,
as hereafter mentioned.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>“These taunts reached me; and procuring a
case of the common holster pistols my servant
rode with, I determined to use them: but they
were so stiff in the trigger that I could hardly let
them off. I fastened on my sword, and putting my
hand under Doctor Merlin’s arm, walked into
the town, and soon saw Fitzgerald, followed by
his mob. He too wore his sword, and I instantly
told him to draw. He answered that he was lame,
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>the pavement bad, and that he could not keep his
footing; that I had Lord Lucan’s mob on my
side; and that, in short, he would not fight me.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I then said, ‘You will find me in the barrack-yard,
where I shall remain.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘I shall be in no hurry, after having struck
you for your pertness,’ said he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“On this I flung a switch into his face, walked
to the barrack, and got sentries posted, with
orders to keep out all persons but Mr. Fitzgerald
and his friend, whilst we should be fighting. He
and Mr. Fenton soon appeared: he had a good
case of pistols in his hand, while I had the
wretched tools I named.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I stood against a projecting part of the barrack
wall, and desired Mr. Fitzgerald to come as
close as he pleased. He said a cannon would not
carry <i>so far</i>. I answered, ‘I will soon cure that, for
I will now march up until I lay my pistol to your
face.’ I accordingly advanced, until our pistols
touched. We both fired: he missed me, but I hit
him full in the breast, and he fell back, supporting
himself by a projection of rock, and exclaiming,
‘Honour, Martin, honour!’</p>

<p class='c004'>“I said,—‘If you are not disabled, I will wait
as long as you choose!’</p>

<p class='c004'>“At this moment, he couched treacherously
like a cat, presented, fired, and hit me. I returned
the fire, and hit him: he again recovered, came
up, begged my pardon, asked to shake hands, and
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>said, ‘Altamont has caused all this, and now
would not send you his carriage;—let us both
kick him!’</p>

<p class='c004'>“Flood met me at the gate, and I leaned on
him. I was taken to Doctor Lendser’s, to have
the wound dressed, but on the way desired my
servant to go with my compliments and inquire
how Mr. Fitzgerald felt. Mr. Flood said, ‘On
no account make any inquiry, or, if he lives, you
will have a second fight.’ I was foolish, as will
appear, and sent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had not been many moments in bed when
my hero entered the room with a careful, timid
step. He said, ‘Doctor, how do you find Mr.
Martin?’ I was quite surprised, but said, ‘I am
very well, and hope you are not badly hurt.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“He then addressed me, and observed, ‘Doctor
Merlin insulted me, and I consider him a
bully, and instrument of yours, and as such I will
make <i>you</i> accountable.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“I answered, ‘If I account with you, on a mutual
understanding that Doctor Merlin is beneath
your notice, I shall have to fight him also for such
an imputation:—so put your renewed quarrel on
some other ground. If you say you did not ask
my pardon, I will fight you again; or if you say
you are fond of such an <i>amusement</i>, I will fight
‘until my eyelids can no longer wag.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Shall you be at Sligo?’ was Mr. Fitzgerald’s
<i>reply</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>“I said, ‘It was not my present purpose; but
if he <i>wished</i> it, I would be there, and that immediately.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“He named the day, to which I assented. It
was <i>reported</i>, but I cannot vouch for the fact, that
a party was sent to intercept and murder me.
Shortly after I reached Sligo, my opponent sent
Sir M. Crafton to say, that ‘Mr. Fitzgerald did
not require any further renewal of the quarrel;’
and thus the affair ended. My surprise at Fitzgerald’s
being alive and well, after having received
two shots from <i>horse-pistols</i> full upon him,
was soon cleared up; he had <i>plated his body</i> so as to
make it completely bullet proof. On receiving
my fire, he fell from the force of the balls striking
him direct, and touching his concealed armour.—My
wound was in the body.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The elegant and gentlemanly appearance of
this man, as contrasted with the savage treachery
of his actions, was extremely curious and without
any parallel of which I am aware.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There were few men who flourished in my
early days that excited more general or stronger
interest than Mr. George Robert Fitzgerald, of
Turlow, the principal object of the preceding
sketch. He was born to an ample fortune, educated
in the best society, had read much, travelled,
and been distinguished at foreign courts: he was
closely allied to one of the most popular and also
to one of the most eminent personages of his own
country; being brother-in-law to Mr. Thomas
Conolly of Castletown, and nephew to the splendid,
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>learned, and ambitious Earl of Bristol, Bishop
of Derry:—yet, so powerfully did some demon
seize upon his mind, and—let us hope—disorder
his intellect, that though its starting was thus
brilliant, his life presented one continuous series
of outrage, and his death was a death of ignominy.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have neither space nor inclination to become
his general biographer;—in truth, he has never,
to my knowledge, had any true one.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Both his
friends and enemies are now all nearly <i>hors de
combat</i>. I know but two contemporaries capable
of drawing his portrait; and in the words of one
of these I have recited an anecdote not unworthy
of being recorded.—I always conceive that a writer
characterising the nearly exhausted generation
of which he has been a contemporary, resembles
a general who dates dispatches from the field of
battle, wherein he details the actions and merits
of his friends or enemies, while the subjects of the
bulletin lie gasping or quite dead before him—and
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>he himself only awaiting the fatal bullet which,
even while he writes, may send him to his comrades.
This is my own case!</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r20'>20</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I have read, in biographical books, George Robert Fitzgerald
described as a great, coarse, violent Irishman, of ferocious
appearance and savage manners. His person and manners
were totally the reverse of this: a more polished and elegant
gentleman was not to be met with. His person was very
slight and juvenile, his countenance extremely mild and insinuating;
and, knowing that he had a <i>turn</i> for single combat,
I always fancied him too <i>genteel</i> to kill any man except with
the <i>small</i>-sword.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>The singular life, and miserable death of Mr.
Fitzgerald form an historic episode which the
plan and character of this work will neither admit
of my detailing nor altogether passing over. The
consideration of his career and catastrophe arouses
in the memory acts and incidents long since erased
from ordinary recollection, and thus, like a mirror,
reflects the manners of the age wherein he lived.</p>

<p class='c004'>While George Robert Fitzgerald was undergoing
a part of his sentence in Newgate, Dublin,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
his brother, Charles Lionel, got possession of the
house and demesne of Turlow, near Castlebar,
County Mayo—one of the most lawless places
then in Ireland. George Robert, as hinted in the
former sketch, had armed and organised a band of
desperadoes, who knew no will but his, and had no
desire but his pleasure. All men were in awe of
them, and the regular army alone was then held
sufficient to curb their outrages. When their
leader was convicted and imprisoned their spirit
was somewhat depressed; but idleness and vice
were by habit so deeply engrafted in their minds,
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>that peaceable or honest means of livelihood were
scouted by them. They were at length proclaimed
outlaws; the military chased them; and
ultimately, a sort of treaty took place, which, like
our modern diplomatic negotiations, exhibited only
one party endeavouring to outwit the other.
The desperadoes agreed to give up all their wild
courses on a promise of pardon; a great proportion
declared they would “take on” for a musket;
and as the army had no objection to receive robbers
and murderers to fight for their king, country,
and religion, their offer was accepted.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r21'>21</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Having been tried and convicted of a most <i>unparalleled</i>
series of assaults upon, and imprisonment of, his own father, he
was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment; but, as we have
before stated, was pardoned (in six months), to the disgrace of
the government.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>About this time my military propensities were
not totally extinguished, but susceptible of being
rekindled by proper stimuli—and Dean Coote,
brother to Sir Eyre Coote, then Commander-in-chief
in India, sent to my father, and made
him what my family considered a magnificent
offer—namely, that one of his sons should forthwith
receive a captain’s commission in the East
India Company’s service, on recruiting a hundred
men for that service, and for each of which
recruits, if the number were completed, twenty
guineas should be paid on their being handed over
to the depôt in Dublin.</p>

<p class='c004'>In acknowledgment of this flattering offer my
father immediately nominated me. I now almost
fancied myself a nabob, or something better, helping
to plunder and dethrone a few of the native
princes—then quite plentiful, and considered fair
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>game by the Honourable Company’s servants, civil
and military. I with joy accepted the proposition—fully
expecting, in four or five years, to return
loaded with lacks of rupeés, and carats of
diamonds, and enabled to realise all my visions of
ulterior happiness. The Dean also sent me the
“beating order” and instructions, with a letter of
introduction, and a strong recommendation to Mr.
Lionel Fitzgerald, then residing at Turlow, requesting
he would aid me in enlisting his brother’s
outlaws for the Company’s service, of whom above
eighty had promised to accept the king’s money on
terms of pardon. All now went on prosperously;
the tenants of Cullenagh brought in every shilling
they could rap or run, to set the young captain
a-spinning; and in a week I was on my road,
through frost and snow, to the county of Mayo:
my father’s old huntsman, Matthew Querns, was
selected to attend me as being most <i>sensible</i>, at
least among the domestics of the family.</p>

<p class='c004'>Matthew was attired in his best field clothing—namely,
a green plush coat, scarlet-laced waistcoat
of old times, buckskin breeches, and a black
leather hunting cap. He carried my portmanteau,
with my volunteer broad-sword buckled to it, behind
him, and his own hunting horn was strapped
by a belt about his middle:—this he sounded at
every inn door, as he said, to make us <i>respectable</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>I was mounted on a large <i>white</i> horse called
Friday, after Robinson Crusoe’s <i>black</i> boy. A
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>case of huge holster pistols jogged before me, and
my cavalry coat-case behind, containing my toilet,
flints, a bullet mould, my flute, my beating
order, with—to amuse leisure hours—a song-book,
and the Sentimental Journey (then in high vogue,
being totally new both in style and subject).
Thus caparisoned and equipped, the late Matthew
Querns and the present Sir Jonah Barrington,
set out, fifty years ago, for the purpose of enlisting
robbers and outlaws in Mayo, to plunder gentoos
in the Carnatic, and establish the Christian religion
on the plains of Hindostan.</p>

<p class='c004'>At that period of my life, cold or fatigue was
nothing when I had an object in view; and at the
end of the third day’s trotting we arrived, through
deep snow, bog roads, and after some tumbles
(miserably tired), at a little cabin at Hallymount,
near the plains of Kilcommon, where many a
bloody battle had been fought in former times;—and
as the ground was too rocky to dig graves,
thousands of human skeletons had been covered
up with stones—of which there is no scarcity in
any, particularly that part of Ireland. Our reception
was curious; and as affording an excellent
idea of the species of inns and innkeepers then
prevalent in Ireland, I shall sketch one of the oddest
imaginable places of “entertainment for man
and horse,”—which notification was written in
large letters over the door,—and the house certainly
did not belie it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>The landlord was a fat, red-nosed, pot-bellied,
jovial fellow, the very emblem of goodnature and
hospitality; he greeted me cordially before he knew
any thing about me, and said I should have the
best his house afforded, together with a hearty welcome
(the welcome of an innkeeper, indeed, is
generally very sincere). He also told Matthew
that he never suffered his bin of oats in the stable
to be closed, always leaving it to gentlemen’s
beasts to eat at their own discretion—as he’d engage
they would stop of themselves when they
had got enough; and the more they eat at one
meal, the less they would eat the next—so he
should be no loser.</p>

<p class='c004'>The inn consisted of cabins on the ground-floor
only, and a very good hard dry floor it certainly
was. The furniture was in character: but
my bed (if I were to judge from its bulk and softness)
had the best feathers of five hundred geese
at least in it: the curtains had obviously once
been the property of some greater personage than
an innkeeper, as the marks of embroidery remained
(on crimson silk), which had been carefully
picked out—I suppose to sell the silver.
My host begged I would not trouble myself as to
dinner, as he knew what was good for me after
so bad a journey. He protested that, so far as
poultry, game, and lobsters went, no man in Mayo
could beat him; and that he had a vessel of Powldoody
oysters, which was sent him by Squire
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>Francis Macnamara, of Doolan, for old acquaintance
sake.</p>

<p class='c004'>I promptly asked for a bottle of his best wine;
but he told me he never sold a <i>single</i> bottle to a
gentleman, and hoped I would have no objection
to two. Of course I acquiesced, though intending
to dine alone and only to drink the half of one.
I was therefore surprised to see shortly a spruce
young maid-servant lay out the table for six persons,
with every thing in good order:—and on
dinner coming in, my landlord introduced his old
wife, two smart pretty daughters, and his son, by
no means a “promising boy.” He uncorked both
bottles at once, and no persons ever fared more
sumptuously. The wine, he said, was the finest
old claret, of the “real smuggling” by Sir Neil
O’Donnel’s own cutter called Paddy Whack, from
the Isle of Man;—and Sir Neil (a baronet of Newport)
never sent a bad hogshead to any of his <i>customers</i>:
his honour’s brandy, likewise, was not a jot
worse than his claret, and always tasted best of a
cold morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>We had got deep into our second bottle, of
which the ladies took a glass each, while the
young gentleman drank a bumper of brandy,
when my host, who knew every body and every
thing local, gave me the life, adventures, and character,
of almost each person of note in that county,
including numerous anecdotes of George Robert,
which originated in, and were confined to
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>the neighbourhood. He laughed so heartily at his
own stories, that it was impossible not to join him.
Tea and hot cakes followed; a roast goose,
brandy punch, and old ale, made the supper, and
I retired to bed hearty and careless.</p>

<p class='c004'>Next morning I was roused rather early by a
very unexpected guest, namely, a hen, which having
got into my room, layed a couple of eggs at
once on my coat, which lay beside me; and then,
as hens accustom themselves to do, (and it is no
bad practice,) she gave as loud and protracted a
notice of her <i>accouchement</i> as her voice could furnish.</p>

<p class='c004'>I immediately rose, brought out my two eggs to
our breakfast-table, and was expressing my surprise
at the circumstance, when Miss Betty Jennings
winked, and whispered me that it was a standing
joke of her father’s.—The breakfast was nearly as
good as the dinner had been the previous day;
and on procuring my bill, I found I was charged
eighteen pence for dinner, eighteen pence for
claret, tenpence for my horses, sixpence for my
breakfast, and nothing for the rest, though Matthew
Querns had got dead drunk, my horses were
nearly bursting, and I was little better myself.
My host told me, when a guest who would drink
with him had a bottle of claret, he always indulged
in one himself; and that if I had drunk two, he
should have thought it mighty uncivil if he had
not done the same. I left his house with an impression
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>that he was the most extraordinary innkeeper
I had ever met with, and really bade adieu
to himself and his daughters with regret.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f22'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r22'>22</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Both Mr. Jenning’s daughters were pretty and pleasant
girls. I observed Miss Betty mending silk stockings, which
was rather odd at the plains of Kilcommon. I told her I fancied
she was kind-hearted, and had an uncommon degree of
sense for her years, and she firmly believed me. I made
her a present of the “Sentimental Journey,” which I had in
my coat-case. I construed the French for her (except two
words): and on my return she told me it had taught her what
<i>sentiment</i> was; that she found she had a great deal of sentiment
herself, but did not know the name of it before; and that she
would always keep the book in kind remembrance of the donor.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Arriving in the course of the day at Turlow,
I found that the whole family were at Castle Magarret;
but Mr. Fitzgerald had got a letter about
me, and all was ready for my reception. I found
I was left to the care of one Hughy Hearn, who had
been a serjeant of the band, but had changed
sides and come over to Mr. Lionel at Turlow,
after losing one of his arms in some skirmish for
George Robert. I did not know who Hughy was
at the time, or I should have kept aloof from him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Hearn,” said I, next day, “have you a
gun in the house? I should like to go out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have, captain,” said he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you powder and shot?” said I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No powder,” said Hughy. “I fired all I had
left of it last night at a man whom I saw skulking
about the road after nightfall.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>“Did you hit him?” asked I, rather alarmed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t say,” replied Hughy: “there was
only one bullet <i>in it</i>, and it’s not so easy to shoot
a man with a single bullet when the night is very
dark—and I’m hard set to aim with one arm,
though I dare say I all as one as <i>scratcht</i> him, for
he cried out, ‘Oh! bad luck to you, Hughy!’ and
ran down the cross lane before I could get the
other double to slap after him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I immediately set about recruiting the outlaws
with the utmost activity and success. I appointed
Hughy Hearn, who had but one arm, my drill-serjeant,
and a monstrous athletic ruffian of the name
of O’Mealy, my corporal, major, and inspector of
recruits. I found no difficulty whatsoever in prevailing
on them to take my money, clap up my
cockade, get drunk, beat the towns-people, and
swear “true allegiance to King George, Sir Eyre
Coote, and myself.” This was the oath I administered
to them, as they all seemed zealous to
come with me; but I took care not to tell them
<i>where</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The kindness and hospitality I meanwhile received
at Turlow, from Mr. and Mrs. Fitzgerald,
was extremely gratifying: nobody could be more
interesting than the latter. There I met two remarkable
persons of that country—George Lyster,
whose finger was broken by George Robert Fitzgerald,
as previously mentioned, and a little, decrepid
sharp-witted dog, called George Elliston,
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>who afterward challenged me, and threatened
Counsellor Saurin, because we did not succeed in
a bad cause of his in the King’s Bench, wherein
we had taken his briefs without fees, as a matter
of kindness to a pretended sufferer.</p>

<p class='c004'>In less than a fortnight I had enlisted between
fifty and sixty able, good-looking outlaws; and as
my money was running low, I determined to march
off my first batch of fifty men, three serjeants, and
three corporals, for Dublin, and having placed them
in depôt there, to return and make up my number
with a replenished purse.</p>

<p class='c004'>To give my march the greater éclat, I chose a
market-day of Castlebar whereon to parade and
address my company. There happened to be also
a fair of linen yarn, and the street was crowded
with cars laden with hanks of yarn of different
sizes and colours. Having drawn up my men, I
ordered each one to get a bumper of whisky; after
which, taking off their hats, they gave three
cheers for King George, Sir Eyre Coote, and Captain
Barrington. I then made them a speech from
the top of a car. I told them we were going to a
place where the halfpennys were made of gold;
where plunder was permitted by the Honourable
Company, and the officers taught their men how
to avail themselves of this permission; where robbery
and murder were not hanging matters, as in
Ireland; where women were married at nine years’
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>old, and every soldier had as many wives as he
could keep from starving, with a right to rob the
rich, in order to support a barrack full of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>In short, I expatiated on all the pleasures and
comforts I purposed for them; and received in return
three more cheers—though neither so long
or loud as I could have wished; and I perceived
a good deal of whispering among my soldiers
which I could not account for, save by the pain
they might feel in taking leave of their fellow-robbers,
as was natural enough. I was, however,
soon undeceived, when, on ordering them to
march, one said aloud, as if he spoke for the rest,
“March <i>is it</i>? march, then, <i>for fat</i>?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Observing their reluctance to quit Castlebar, I
felt my young, slight, and giddy self swell with all
the pride and importance of a martinet; I almost
fancied myself a giant, and my big recruits mere
pigmies. “Here, serjeant,” said I arrogantly to
Hughy Hearn, “draw up those <i>mutineers</i>: fall in—fall
in!” but nobody fell in, and Serjeant Hearn
himself fell <i>back</i>. “Serjeant,” pursued I, “this
moment arrest Corporal O’Mealy, he’s the ringleader.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He won’t <i>let</i> me, captain,” replied Serjeant
Hearn.</p>

<p class='c004'>“’Tis your captain’s command!” exclaimed I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He says your honour’s no captain at all,” said
Hughy Hearn; “only a slip of a <i>crimp</i>, nothing
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>else but a gaoler’s son, that wants to sell the boys
like <i>negers</i>, all as one as Hart and the green linnets
in Dublin city.”</p>

<p class='c004'>My choler could no longer be restrained:—I
drew my broadsword, and vowed I would divide
the head of the first man that refused to march.
“I’ll teach these mutineers to obey his majesty’s
commission and officer,” said I.</p>

<p class='c004'>Corporal O’Mealy and two others then took off
their hats, and coming up to me, said with great
good-humour and civility, “Well, captain dear,
you’ll forgive and forget a joke from your own
boys, so you will. Sure ’twas nothin else but a
parting joke for the fair, your honour! Arrah!
put up that sliver of yours: sure it looks nasty in
the fair, to be drawing your falchion on your own
recruits, captain.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I had no suspicion; and the hanger was scarce
secure in its scabbard, when some of my soldiers
came behind me, and others in front, and I was
completely surrounded. “I’ll show you all that
I am a captain, and a true captain,” continued I.
“Here, serjeant! bring me my beating orders.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“<i>Beating</i>—Ough! is <i>that</i> what you’d be at?”
said Corporal O’Mealy, who now assumed the command.
“Ough! if it’s ‘beating’ you want, by my
sowl you’ll be easily satisfied without Hughy
Hearn’s orders.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I could stand it no longer: I could not run away
if I wished; a crowd was collecting around me,
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>and so I sprang at the smallest of the recruits,
whom I thought I could master, and seized him by
the throat; but a smart crack given with a hank
of linen yarn by some hand behind soon made me
quit my prey; another crack from another quarter
quickly followed. I turned round to see my executioners,
when I was suddenly wheeled back by
the application of a third hank. This <i>cracking</i>,
like a <i>feu de joie</i>, increased every moment, and
was accompanied with vociferous laughs. In
short, they pounded me almost to a jelly with
hanks of linen yarn, which lay ready to their hands
on all the cars around us. At length, stooping
down between two cars, I had the pleasure of
seeing the whole of my recruits, drawn up by
O’Mealy—for it appeared he was their <i>real captain</i>—march
regularly by me, every fellow in turn
saluting any part of me he thought proper with a
hank of yarn;—and with a shout I still remember
of “A George! a George! long life to our colonel!”
they quitted the fair—as I learned, to take forcible
possession of a house and farm from which one
of them had been ejected—which feat I afterward
heard they regularly performed that very night,
with the addition of <i>roasting</i> the new proprietor
in his own kitchen.</p>

<p class='c004'>Though I had no bones broken, some of my flesh
took pretty much the colour and consistence of
what cooks call aspic jelly. I was placed on a
low garron, and returned to Turlow at night, sick,
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>sore, and sorry. There I pretended I was only
<i>fatigued</i>, and had taken cold; and after experiencing
the kind hospitality of Mrs. Fitzgerald—then
a most interesting young lady—on the fourth
day, at an early hour of a frosty morning, old
Matthew Querns and I mounted our horses, without
my having obtained any thing more for my
trouble, and money spent in the recruiting service,
than a sound beating. A return carriage of Lord
Altamont’s having overtaken me on the road, I entered
it, and was set down at the little inn at Hallymount,
where I remained some days with Mr.
Jennings and family, recovering from my bruises,
and sighing over the wreck of my fondly anticipated
glories as a renowned colonel at the head of my
regiment, plundering a pagoda and picking precious
stones out of an idol. But, alas! having lost
all the remaining cash out of my pocket during the
scuffle at Castlebar, instead of a <i>lac</i> of <i>rupees</i>, I found
myself labouring under a complete <i>lack</i> of <i>guineas</i>,
and was compelled to borrow sufficient from Candy,
the innkeeper at Ballynasloe, to carry me
home by easy stages. Thus did my military ardour
receive its definitive cooling: no ice-house
ever chilled champaign more effectually. I, however,
got quite enough of hospitality at Turlow,
and quite enough of thrashing at Castlebar, to engraft
the whole circumstances on my memory.</p>

<p class='c004'>This journey gave me an opportunity of inspecting
all the scenes of Mr. George Robert Fitzgerald’s
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>exploits. The cave in which he confined
his father, showed to me by Hughy Hearn, was
concealed by bushes, and wrought under one of
the old Danish moats, peculiar, I believe, to Ireland.
Yet, in the perpetration of that act of brutality,
almost of parricide, he kept up the singular
inconsistency of his character. Over the entrance
to the subterraneous prison of his parent a specimen
of classic elegance is exhibited by this inscription
graven on a stone:</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>A NIGHT JOURNEY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Fitzgerald’s agent and attorney—Capriciousness of courage—Jack tar, his intrepidity—New lights—Sailors and saints—Description of Mr. T——&nbsp;—His temerity in court and timorousness out of it—Regularly retained by Fitzgerald—Starts with him on a journey to Turlow—Travelling companions—The eloquent <i>snore</i>—Mr. T——’s apprehensions—A daylight discovery—Double escape of the solicitor—His return to Dublin—Mr. Brecknock, his successor—Fate of that individual—The “murderer murdered.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. T——, a solicitor of repute in Dublin, had
been selected by George Robert Fitzgerald to
transact all his law and other business, as his
attorney and agent.</p>

<p class='c004'>The choice was extremely judicious:—Fitzgerald
had made a secret vow, that while he
existed, he never would encourage such a nest of
<i>tricksters</i> and <i>extortioners</i> as attorneys, by paying
<i>any</i> bill of cost, right or wrong, long or short; and
to carry this pious vow into full execution, so far
as regarded <i>one</i> attorney, he could not have made
a better selection than that above stated.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>There are few qualities of the human mind more
capricious than courage; and I have known many
instances in my passage through life, wherein men
have been as courageous as a lion on one occasion,
and as timorous as a little girl on others. I
knew an English general who had never failed to
signalise himself by intrepidity and contempt for
death or fracture when engaged with the enemy,
and was yet the most fearful being in the world
lest he should be overset in a mail-coach. I have
known men ready to fight any thing by daylight,
run like hares in the night-time from the very
same object. The capriciousness of courage is,
indeed, so unaccountable, that it has ever been to
me a source of amusing reflection. Not being
myself of a very timorous disposition, and though
I cannot say I ever experienced great fear of actual
death in any proper reasonable way by the hands
of a Christian—nay, even should it be a doctor—I
always felt the greatest dread of getting a bite
from the teeth of a mastiff, and never passed the
heels of a horse without experiencing strong symptoms
of cowardice. I always felt much stouter by
daylight too than in the night-time.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have ever observed that the courage of <i>sailors</i>
is, of all other species, the most perfect. I scarce
ever met a common sailor that had <i>any</i> sense of
danger; the two most tremendous elements, fire
and water, they totally disregard, and defy hurricanes
and cannon, as if they were no more than
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span><i>Zephyrs</i> or <i>Catherine-wheels</i>. They have not the
same chance of getting away with soldiers from
their combats:—a sailor cannot rest one second
from fighting till the battle is ended; and a few
years’ experience of burning, sinking, bombarding,
blasting, and blowing up,—of thunder, lightning,
and shipwreck,—ossifies the <i>nerves</i>, or rather
changes them into <i>muscles</i>, and renders habit second
nature. The sailor, therefore, acquires a
constitutional contempt for danger in all its ramifications,
while the soldiers’ battles are <i>comparatively</i>
quiet, regular transactions, and their generals take
themselves carefully out of the fray if they imagine
they are getting the worst of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have always, in fact, conceived that the
noblest fighting ever invented was a sea battle,
and the most intrepid animal in the creation, a
British sailor. How far the new lights, in changing
their natural <i>rum</i> into <i>hot water</i>, their <i>grog</i> into
<i>bohea tea</i>, and their <i>naval dialect</i> into <i>methodistical
canting</i>, may increase their courage (which was
already ample), is for the projectors to determine.
Our naval victories over the whole world proved
that no change of liquids was necessary: when any
thing cannot be <i>improved</i>, alteration is injurious;
and I cannot help thinking that one sailor sending
his compliments by a cabin-boy to a brother tar,
requesting the “honour of his company to take
a dish of <i>tea</i> with him after <i>prayers</i>,” is perfectly
ridiculous. God send it may not be worse than
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>ridiculous!—You may man your fleet with <i>saints</i>:
but remember, it was the old <i>sinners</i> that gained
your victories.</p>

<p class='c004'>But to recover from one of my usual digressions:
I must now advert, though in a very different
point of view, to the bravery of <i>attorneys</i>, and
exemplify the species of capriciousness I allude to
in the person of Mr. T——. There was not another
solicitor or practitioner in the four courts of
Dublin, who showed more fortitude or downright
bravery on all <i>law</i> proceedings. He never
was known to flinch at any thing of the kind;
would contest a <i>nisi prius</i> from morning till night
without sense of danger; and even after a defeat,
would sit down at his desk to draw out his bill of
costs, with as much <i>sang froid</i> as a French general,
in Napoleon’s time, would write despatches
upon a drum-head in the midst of action.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet, with all this fortitude, he presented a singular
example of the anomaly I have alluded to.
Nature had given him a set of nerves as strong
as chain cables, when used in mooring his clients’
concerns; and it seemed as if he had another and
totally different set (of the nature of packthread) for
his own purposes. His first set would have answered
a sailor, his last a <i>young lady</i>; in plain English, he
would sooner lose a good bill of costs, than run a risk
of provoking any irritable country gentleman to
<i>action</i>. In such cases he was the most mild, bland,
and humble antagonist that a debtor could look
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>for. Such (and, I repeat, most judiciously chosen)
was the attorney of George Robert Fitzgerald. In
person he was under the middle proportion;—and
generally buttoned up in a black single-breasted
coat, with what was then called a flaxen
Beresford bob-wig, and every thing to match. I
remember him well, and a neat, smug, sharp, <i>half-century</i>
man he was.</p>

<p class='c004'>This gentleman had been newly engaged by Mr.
Fitzgerald to prepare numerous leases for his desperadoes;
to serve ejectments on half his reputable
tenantry; to do various other acts according
to law, with a high hand in the county of Galway;
and to go down with him to Turlow, to see that
all was duly executed. The several preparations
for these things were of a very expensive description,
and therefore the attorney would fain have
had a little <i>advance</i> toward stamps, office-fees, &amp;c.:
but on remotely hinting this, Mr. Fitzgerald replied
(with one of those mild, engaging modes of
muzzling people in which he was so great a proficient),
“Surely, Mr. T——, you don’t doubt my
honour and punctuality,”—which kind expression
he accompanied by such a look as that wherewith
the serpent is said to fascinate its prey.</p>

<p class='c004'>This expressive glance brought down Mr. T——
to the exclamation—“O Lord, Mr. Fitzgerald,
doubt your honour! O not at all, sir. I only, Mr.
Fitzgerald, only—”</p>

<p class='c004'>Here George Robert, with a bland smile, and
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>graceful motion of the hand, told him, “that he
need say <i>no more</i>,” and desired him to make out his
bill of costs in full, to have it ready receipted, and
so soon as they arrived among Mr. Fitzgerald’s
tenantry at Turlow, Mr. T—— might be assured
he’d pay him off entirely <i>without taxing</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. T—— was quite charmed, expressed his
satisfaction, and declared his readiness to accompany
his client to Turlow, after a few days’ preparation
in engrossing leases, having one thousand
five hundred ejectments filled up, and other preliminaries.
“And be so good,” said Mr. Fitzgerald,
“to include in your bill, this time, all the expenses
of your former journey to Turlow (where I fear you
were badly accommodated), as well as what may
be due upon every other account. I intend to settle
all at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. T—— was still more delighted:—all matters
were prepared, the bills of costs reckoned,
with a full acquittance and discharge for the
whole (except the date) at the conclusion, to prevent
delay or cavil; all the leases, ejectments,
&amp;c. were duly packed in a trunk, and the day
fixed for setting out for Turlow; when Mr. Fitzgerald
sent for the attorney, and told him, that if
his going down was previously known, there were
several of the tenants and others, under the adverse
influence of his father and brother, who
would probably abscond; and that therefore, since
spies were watching him perpetually, to give notice
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>in the county of his every movement, it was
expedient that he should set out two or three
hours before day-break, so as to have the start of
them. That his own travelling carriage should be
ready near the gate of the Phœnix Park, to take
up Mr. T——, who might bring his trunk of
papers with him thither in a hack carriage, so
that there may be no suspicion.</p>

<p class='c004'>All this was both reasonable and proper, and
accordingly done. Mr. Fitzgerald’s carriage was
on the spot named, near the wall of the Phœnix
Park. The attorney was punctual; the night
pitch-dark; and the trunk of papers put into the
boot; the windows were all drawn up; Mr. T—— stepped
into the carriage with as great satisfaction
as ever he had felt in his whole lifetime, and away
they drove cheerily, at a good round pace, for the
county of Galway.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. T—— had no idea that any body else was
coming with them—Mr. Fitzgerald not having at
all mentioned such a thing. He found, however,
a third gentleman in a travelling cloak sitting between
himself and his client, who was dozing in the
far corner. This stranger, too, he found not over-courteous;
for though the carriage was not very
roomy, and the gentleman was bulky, he showed
no disposition whatever to accommodate the attorney,
who begged him, with great suavity and politeness,
to “move a little.” To this he received
no reply, but a snoring both from the strange traveller
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>and Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. T—— now felt
himself much crowded and pressed, and again
earnestly requested “the gentleman” to allow
him, if possible, a little more room: but he still
only received a snore in return. He now concluded
that his companion was a low, vulgar fellow.
His nerves became rather lax: he got
alarmed, without well knowing why; he began to
twitter—the twitter turned into a shake; and, as is
generally the case, the shake ended with a cold
sweat, and Mr. T—— found himself in a state of
mind and body far more disagreeable than he had
ever before experienced. The closeness and pressure
had elicited a hot perspiration on the one
side; while his fears produced a cold perspiration
on the other: so that (quite unlike the ague he
had not long recovered from) he had hot and
cold fits at the same moment. All his apprehensions
were now awakened: his memory opened
her stores; and he began to recollect dreadful
anecdotes of Mr. Fitzgerald, which he never before
had credited, or indeed had any occasion to remember.
The ruffians of Turlow passed as the ghosts in
Macbeth before his imagination. Mr. Fitzgerald he
supposed was in a fox’s sleep, and his <i>bravo</i> in
another,—who, instead of receding at all, on the
contrary squeezed the attorney closer and closer.
His respiration now grew impeded, and every fresh
idea exaggerated his horror; his surmises were of
the most frightful description; his <i>untaxed costs</i>, he
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>anticipated, would prove his certain death, and
that a cruel one! neither of his companions would
answer him a single question, the one replying
only by a rude snore, and the other by a still
ruder.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now,” thought Mr. T——, “my fate is consummated.
I have often heard how Mr. Fitzgerald
cut a Jew’s throat in Italy, and slaughtered
numerous creditors while on the grand tour of
Europe. God help me! unfortunate solicitor
that I am! my last day, or rather night, is
come!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He thought to let down the window, and admit
a little fresh air, but it was quite fast. The whole
situation was insupportable; and at length he addressed
Mr. Fitzgerald, most pathetically, thus:
“Mr. Fitzgerald, I’ll <i>date the receipt</i> the moment
you choose; and whenever it’s your <i>convenience</i>, I
have no doubt you’ll pay it most honourably; no
doubt, no doubt, Mr. Fitzgerald! but not necessary
at all till perfectly <i>convenient</i>—or <i>never</i>, if more
agreeable to you, and <i>this other gentleman</i>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Fitzgerald could now contain himself no longer,
but said, quite in good-humour, “Oh, very well,
Mr. T——, very well: quite time enough; make
yourself easy on that head.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The carriage now arrived at Maynooth, where
the horses were instantly changed, and they proceeded
rapidly on their journey—Mr. Fitzgerald
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>declaring he would not alight till he reached Turlow,
for fear of pursuit.</p>

<p class='c004'>The attorney now took courage, and very truly
surmising that the other gentleman was a <i>foreigner</i>,
ventured to beg of Mr. Fitzgerald to ask “his
friend” to sit <i>over</i> a little, as he was quite
<i>crushed</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Fitzgerald replied, “That the party in
question did not speak English;—but when they
arrived at Killcock, the matter should be better
arranged.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The attorney was now compelled, for some time
longer, to suffer the <i>hot-press</i>, inflicted with as little
compunction as if he were only a sheet of paper;
but on arriving at the inn at Killcock, dawn
just appeared; and Mr. Fitzgerald, letting down a
window, desired his servant, who was riding with
a pair of large horse-pistols before him, to rouse
the people at the inn, and get some cold provisions
and a bottle of wine brought to the carriage:
“And, Thomas,” said he, “get five or six pounds
of raw meat, if you can—no matter of what kind—for
this <i>foreign gentleman</i>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The attorney was now petrified:—a little twilight
glanced into the carriage, and nearly turned
him into stone. The stranger was wrapped up in
a blue travelling cloak with a scarlet cape, and
had a great white cloth tied round his head and
under his chin;—but when Mr. Solicitor saw the
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span><i>face</i> of his companion, he uttered a piteous cry,
and involuntarily ejaculated, “Murder! murder!”
On hearing this cry, the servant rode back to the
carriage-window and pointed to his pistols. Mr.
T—— now offered his soul up to God, the stranger
grumbled, and Mr. Fitzgerald, leaning across, put
his hand to the attorney’s mouth, and said, he
should direct his servant to give him <i>reason</i> for
that cry, if he attempted to alarm the people in
the house. Thomas went into the inn, and immediately
returned with a bottle of wine and some
bread, but reported that there was no raw meat to
be had—on hearing which, Mr. Fitzgerald ordered
him to seek some at another house. The attorney
now exclaimed again, “God protect me!”—Streaming
with perspiration, his eye every now
and then glancing toward his mysterious companion,
and then starting aside with horror, he at
length shook as if he were relapsing into his old
ague; and the stranger, finding so much unusual
motion beside him, turned his countenance upon
the attorney. Their cheeks came in contact, and
the reader must imagine—because it is impossible
adequately to describe—the scene that followed.
The stranger’s profile was of uncommon prominence;
his mouth stretched from ear to ear; he
had enormous grinders, with a small twinkling
eye; and his visage was all bewhiskered and
mustachoed, more even than Count Platoff’s of the
Cossacks.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>Mr. T——’s optic nerves were paralysed, as he
gazed instinctively at his horrid companion; in
whom, when he recovered his sense of vision sufficiently
to scrutinise him, he could trace no similitude
to any being on earth save a <i>bear</i>!</p>

<p class='c004'>And the attorney was quite correct in this comparison;
it was actually a Russian bear, which
Mr. Fitzgerald had <i>educated</i> from a cub, and which
generally accompanied his master on his travels.
He now gave bruin a rap upon the nose with a
stick which he carried, and desired him to hold up
his head. The brute obeyed: Fitzgerald then
ordered him to <i>kiss</i> his <i>neighbour</i>; and the beast
did as he was told, but accompanied his salute
with such a tremendous roar, as roused the attorney
(then almost swooning) to a full sense of his
danger. Self-preservation is the first law of Nature,
and at once gives courage, and suggests
devices. On this occasion, every other kind of
law—civil, criminal, or equitable—was set aside by
the attorney. All his ideas, if any he had, were
centred in one word—“escape;” and as a weasel,
it is said, will attack a man if driven to desperation,
so did the attorney spurn the menaces of
Mr. Fitzgerald, who endeavoured to hold and detain
him. The struggle was violent, but brief;
bruin roared loud, but interfered not. Horror
strengthened the solicitor; dashing against the
carriage-door, he burst it open; and tumbling
out, reeled into the public-house,—then rushing
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>through a back door, and up a narrow lane that
led to the village of Summer-hill (Mr. Roly’s demesne),
about two miles distant, he stumbled over
hillocks, tore through hedges and ditches, and
never stopped till he came breathless to the little
alehouse, completely covered with mud, and his
clothes in rags. He there told so incoherent a
story, that the people all took him for a man either
bitten by a mad-dog or broken loose from his
keepers; and considered it their duty to <i>tie</i> him,
to prevent his <i>biting</i> or other mischief. In that
manner they led him to Squire Roly’s, at the
great house, where the hapless attorney was
pinioned and confined in a stable for some hours
till the squire got up. They put plenty of milk,
bread, butter, and cheese into the <i>manger</i>, from
the cock-loft above, to prevent accidents as they
said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus situated, Mr. T—— had leisure to come
somewhat to his recollection, so as to be able to tell
the story rather rationally to Mr. Roly, when he
came to examine him—being held fast by four men
while under interrogation; the result of which nearly
killed old Roly with laughter. The attorney was
now released, invited into the house to clean himself,
and supplied with a surtout coat and hat; and
after offering as many thanksgivings as could be
expected from a solicitor of those days, for his providential
escape, he had a comfortable breakfast
provided; and at his earnest desire, Mr. Roly sent
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>one of his carriages, and two armed servants, with
him to his own house in Dublin, where he safely
arrived in due season.</p>

<p class='c004'>This adventure was circulated throughout Dublin
with rapidity (as every thing comical then was),
but with many variations and additions; and I remember
it a standing story in every company that
relished a joke.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was some months before Mr. T—— wholly
recovered from his terror; and several clients, who
lost their causes, attributed their failures to the
bear having turned the brain and injured the legal
capacity and intellect of their lawyer. However,
as a proof of the old adage, that “whatever is, is
right,” this very adventure in all probability saved
Mr. T—— from being hanged and quartered (as
will immediately appear). So terrific did the very
idea of George Robert Fitzgerald appear to him
afterward, that he never ventured to ask him for
the amount of his bill of costs, and <i>gave</i> him (in a
negative way) all the leases, ejectments, and
papers—together with his wardrobe, and a trifle
of cash contained in his trunk which was left in
the carriage.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Fitzgerald, having long had a design to put
one Mr. M‘Donnell, of his county, <i>hors du combat</i>,
for some old grudge, determined to seek an opportunity
of doing it under the colour of M‘Donnell’s
illegal resistance to a law process, which process
Mr. T—— had (innocently) executed; in which
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>case the attorney would, of course, as sportsmen
say, “be in at the death.”</p>

<p class='c004'>After the affair of the bear, no attorney or
other legal man would entrust himself at Turlow;—it
was, therefore, some time before Mr. Fitzgerald
could carry the above purpose into execution;—when,
at length, he found an old lawyer, who,
with the aid of Mr. T——’s said ejectments,
leases, &amp;c. struck out a legal pretence for <i>shooting</i>
Mr. M‘Donnell, which would probably have been
fathered upon poor Mr. T—— if the bear had not
stood his friend and packed him off to Summerhill
instead of Turlow. As it was, this man (whose
name was Brecknock), who acted for Fitzgerald
as agent, adviser, attorney, &amp;c. was hanged for
his pains, as an accessory before the fact, in giving
Mr. Fitzgerald a <i>legal</i> opinion; and Mr. Fitzgerald
himself was hanged for the murder, solely on the
evidence of his own groom, Scotch Andrew, the
man who really <i>committed</i> it, by firing the fatal
blunderbuss.</p>

<p class='c004'>There can be no doubt he deserved the death
he met; but there is also no doubt he was not
legally convicted; and old Judge Robinson, then
accounted the best lawyer on the bench, sarcastically
remarked, that “the murderer was murdered.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This incident had escaped both my notes and
memory, when it was fully revived by the affair
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>between my good old friend, Richard Martin of
Connemara, and Mr. Fitzgerald, described in a
preceding sketch, and originating in the latter
yoking his own father in a dray by the side of
that very bear.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>MARTIAL LAW.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Law in Ireland half a century ago—Its delay remedied, but not its uncertainty—Principal and Interest—Eustace Stowell and Richard Martin—Valuable <i>precedents</i>—A bloodless duel—High sheriffs and their <i>Subs</i>—Irish method of serving a writ—Cases of warranty—Messrs. Reddy Long and Charley White—The latter guarantees an unsound horse to the author—Zeal of a <i>second</i>—Mr. Reddy Long’s valuable legacy to Sir Jonah Barrington.</p>

<p class='c006'>The administration of the law among gentlemen
in Ireland fifty years back, is curiously illustrated
by the following little narrative, the circumstances
whereof have been communicated to me from such
a quarter as not to admit of their being doubted.</p>

<p class='c004'>Our laws, in their most regular course (as every
body knows, who has had the honour and happiness
of being much involved in them), are neither
so fleet as a race-horse, nor so cheap as water-cresses.
They indisputably require eloquent advocates
and keen attorneys;—who expound, complicate,
unriddle, or confuse, the respective statutes,
points, precedents, and practice, of that
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>simple science, which too frequently, like a burning-glass,
consumes both sides of what it shines
upon.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some prudent and sensible gentlemen, therefore,
principally in the country parts of Ireland
(who probably had bit upon the bridle), began to
conceive that justice ought to be neither so dear
nor so tardy; and when they reflected that what
were called their “barking irons” brought all
ordinary disputes to a speedy termination—why,
thought they, should not these be equally applicable
to matters of law, property, and so forth, as
to matters of honour? At all events, such an
application would be incalculably <i>cheaper</i>, than
any taxed bill of costs, even of the most conscientious
solicitor.</p>

<p class='c004'>This idea became very popular in some counties,
and, indeed, it had sundry old precedents in
its favour,—the writ of right and trial by battle
having been originally the law of the land, and
traditionally considered as far the most honourable
way of terminating a suit. They considered,
therefore, that what was lawful one day, could not
be justly deemed unlawful another, and that by
shortening the process of distributing justice, they
should assist in extending it. The old jokers
said, and said truly, that many a cause had been
decided to a <i>dead</i> certainty in a few minutes, by
simply touching a trigger, upon which attorneys,
barristers, judges, jurors, witnesses, and sometimes
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>all the peers of the realm, spiritual and temporal,
had been working and fumbling for a series
of years without bringing it even to an <i>un</i>satisfactory
issue.</p>

<p class='c004'>My old and worthy friend, “Squire Martin,”
afforded a most excellent illustration of this practice;
and as all the parties were “gentlemen to
the backbone,” the anecdote may be deemed a
<i>respectable</i> one. I have often heard the case
quoted in different companies, as a beneficial
mode of ensuring a compromise. But the report
of my friend makes it any thing but a <i>compromise</i>
on his part. The retrograding was no doubt on the
part of <i>the enemy</i>, and equally unequivocal as Moreau’s
through the Black Forest, or that of the
ten thousand Greeks, though neither so brave
nor so bloody as either of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>I name place, parties, cause, proceedings, and
final judgment—just as I received these particulars
from the defendant himself; and I consider the
case as forming a very <i>valuable precedent</i> for corresponding
ones.</p>

<p class='c004'>Eustace Stowell, Esq. challenger.</p>

<p class='c004'>Richard Martin, Esq. acceptor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Operator for the challenger, D. Blake, Esq.</p>

<p class='c004'>Operator for the acceptor, Right Honourable
St. George Daly, late judge of the King’s Bench,
Ireland.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span><i>Case as reported by Defendant.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>Eustace Stowell lent me a sum of money on
interest, which interest I had not paid <i>very</i> regularly.
Mistaking my means, I promised to pay
him at a certain time, but failed. He then called
on me, and said I had broken my word. I answered,
“Yes, I have, but I could not help it.
I am very sorry, but in a few days will satisfy the
demand.” Accordingly, my worthy friend the late
Earl of Mountjoy accepted my bills at three and
six months for the whole amount.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having arranged the business thus, I enclosed
the bills to Mr. Eustace Stowell, who immediately
returned them, saying, that as I had broken my
word, he would accept of no payment but hard
money.</p>

<p class='c004'>I replied that I had no hard money, nor was
there much of it afloat in my part of the country;
upon which Mr. Eustace Stowell immediately sent
his friend to me, requiring me either to give him
cash or <i>personal satisfaction</i>; and in the latter event,
to appoint time and place. My answer was, that
I did not want to shoot him unless he <i>insisted</i> upon
it; but that as to <i>cash</i>, though Solomon was a
wise man, and Sampson a strong one, neither of
them could pay ready money if they had it not.
So I prepared to engage him: my friend the
Right Honourable St. George Daly, since judge
of the King’s Bench, assisted in arranging preliminaries
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>to our mutual satisfaction, and pretty
early next morning we met to <i>fight out</i> the debt in
that part of the Phœnix Park called the Fifteen
Acres.</p>

<p class='c004'>Every thing proceeded regularly, as usual. Our
pistols were loaded, and the distance measured,
eight yards from muzzle to muzzle. I stepped on
my ground, he on his. I was just presenting my
pistol at his body, when, having, I suppose, a presentiment
that he should go somewhere out of this
world if I let fly at him, he instantly dropped his
weapon, crying out, “Mr. Martin! Mr. Martin!
a pretty sort of <i>payment</i> this! You’d shoot me for
my interest money, would you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it’s your <i>pleasure</i>, Mr. Eustace Stowell,”
said I, “I certainly will; but it was not my desire
to come here, or to shoot you. You insisted
on it yourself: so go on, if you please, now we
are here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What security will you give me, Mr. Martin,”
said he, “for my interest money?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What I have offered you already,” said I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what’s that?” demanded Mr. Stowell.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I offered you Lord Mountjoy’s bills at three
and six months,” said I. Before I had time to
finish the last words Mr. Stowell cried out,
“Nothing can be better or more reasonable, Mr.
Martin; I accept the offer with pleasure. No
better payment can be. It is singular you did not
make this offer <i>before</i>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think,” said I, “you had better take your
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>ground again, Mr. Eustace Stowell, for I tell you
I <i>did</i> make this offer before, and may be you don’t
like so plump a contradiction. If not, I’m at your
service. Here is a letter under your own hand,
returning the bills and declining to receive them.
See, read that!” continued I, handing it him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bless me!” said he, “there must be some
great misunderstanding in this business. All’s
right and honourable. I hope the whole will be
forgotten, Mr. Martin.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certainly, Mr. Stowell,” replied I: “but I
trust you’ll not be so hard to please about your
interest money in future, when it’s not convenient
to a gentleman to pay it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed, and we all four stepped into the
same carriage, returned the best friends possible,
and I never heard any thing irritating about his
interest money afterward.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c004'>This case, however, was only a simple one on
the <i>money counts</i>—a mere matter of <i>assumpsit</i>, in
which all the gross and ungentlemanly legal expressions
used in law declarations on <i>assumpsits</i>
were totally avoided—such as “intending thereby
to deceive and defraud:”—language which, though
<i>legal</i>, a Galway gentleman would as soon eat his
horse as put up with from his equal—though
he would bear it from a shopkeeper with sovereign
indifference. When such a one, therefore,
was sued in <i>assumpsit</i> for a horse or so by a
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>gentleman, the attorney never let his client read
the law declaration—the result of which would
be injurious to two of the parties at least, as one
of the litigants would probably lose his life, and
the attorney the litigation. The foregoing cause
was conducted with as much politeness and decorum
as could possibly be expected between four
high well-bred persons, who, not having “the
fear of God before their eyes,” but, as law indictments
very properly set forth, “being moved
and seduced by the instigation of the devil,” had
congregated for the avowed purpose of committing
or aiding in one or more wilful and deliberate
murders.</p>

<p class='c004'>I must here observe that, in addition to the other
advantages this mode of proceeding between gentlemen
had over that of courts of justice, a certain
principle of equity was understood to be connected
with it. After a gentleman was regularly called
out, and had duly fought the challenger respecting
any sum of money, whether the trial ended in
death or not, after a single shot the demand was
extinguished and annulled for ever: no man can
be sued twice for the same debt. Thus, the challenger
in a money case stood in rather an unpleasant
situation—as, exclusive of the chance of getting
a <i>crack</i>, the money was for ever gone, whether
his adversary lived or died—unless, indeed, the
acceptor, being a “gentleman <i>every inch of him</i>,”
might feel disposed to waive his “privilege.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>But this short, cheap, and decisive mode of
terminating causes was not confined to simple
money counts; it extended to all actions at law
and proceedings in equity. The grand old procrastinators
of Irish courts—<i>demurrers</i> and <i>injunctions</i>—were
thus dissolved or obviated by a <i>trigger</i>,
in a shorter time than the judges took to put
on their wigs and robes. Actions also of trover,
assault, trespass, detenu, replevin, covenant, &amp;c.
&amp;c. were occasionally referred to this laudable
branch of jurisprudence with great success, seldom
failing of being finally decided by seven
o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>The system was also resorted to by betters at
cock-fights, horse-races, or hurlings; as well as
on account of breaches of marriage-contracts
with sisters, nieces, or cousins; or of distraining
cattle, beating other gentlemen’s servants, &amp;c.
&amp;c.: but none were more subject to the <i>trigger
process</i> than high sheriffs when their year was
over, if they had permitted their <i>subs</i> to <i>lay on</i> (as
they called it) such things as executions, <i>fieri
facias</i>, or <i>scire facias</i>, <i>haberes</i>, &amp;c.; or to molest the
person, property, or blood relations, of any <i>real</i>
and spirited gentleman in his own bailiwick, or <i>out
of it</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The high sheriff being thus, by the laws of
custom, honour, and the country gentlemen of
Ireland, subject to be either shot or horsewhipped,
or forced to commit a breach of public duty, very
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>fortunately discovered an antidote to this poison
in the person of his sub-sheriff—an officer generally
selected from the breed of country attorneys.
Now, it was an invariable engagement of the <i>sub</i>
that he should keep, guarantee, and preserve his
<i>high</i> from all manner of injury and annoyances.
But as it was by common accord decided, that a
sub-sheriff could not possibly be considered a
<i>gentleman</i>, none such would do him the honour of
fighting him. Yet, being necessitated to adopt
some mode of keeping the <i>high</i> out of the fangs of
fire-eaters, and himself from a fracture by the <i>butt-end</i>
of a loaded whip, or the welts of a cutting one,
or of having his “seat of honour” treated as if it
were a foot-ball, the <i>sub</i> struck out a plan of preventing
any catastrophe of the kind—which plan,
by aid of a little smart affidavit, generally succeeded
extremely well in the superior courts.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the sub-sheriff received a writ or process
calculated to annoy any gentleman (<i>every inch of
him</i>, or <i>to the backbone</i>), he generally sent his
bailiff at night to inform the gentleman that he had
such a writ or process, hoping the squire would
have no objection to send him the little fees on it
with a small <i>douceur</i>, and he would pledge his
word and honour that the squire should hear no
more about the matter for that year. If the
gentleman had not by him the amount of the
fees (as was generally the case), he faithfully
<i>promised</i> them, which being considered a debt of
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span><i>honour</i>, was always, like a gambling debt, entitled
to be earliest paid. Upon this, the sub, as soon
as he was forced to make a return to such writs,
did make a very sweeping one—namely, that the
defendant had neither “body nor goods.” This
was, if required, confirmed by the little smart affidavit;
and if still doubted by the court, the <i>sub</i>
never wanted plenty of <i>respectable</i> corroborating
bailiffs to kiss <i>their thumbs</i>, and rescue the <i>high</i>
out of any trifling dilemma that “his honour
might get into through the Dublin people, bad
luck to them all! root and branch, dead or alive,”
as the country <i>bums</i> usually expressed themselves.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of the general application of this decisive mode
of adjudicating cases of warranty and guarantee,
I can give a tolerably clear example in my own
proper person. When very young, I was spending
a day at a cottage belonging to Mr. Reddy Long,
of Moat, near Ballyragget, a fire-eater, when one
Mr. Charley White sold me a horse for ten guineas,
which he warranted sound, and which seemed
well worth the money. Next day, when the
seller had departed, the beast appeared to my
host (not to me) to limp somewhat, and the dealing
had thereby the appearance of jockeyship and
false warranty—which occurring in the house of a
fire-eater, rendered the <i>injury</i> an <i>insult</i>, and was
accounted totally unpardonable. I knew, that if
the beast were really lame, I could oblige the seller
to return the money; and accordingly told my
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>host that if it turned out unsound, I’d get John
Humphreys, the attorney, to write to Charley
White to <i>refund</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>“An <i>attorney</i> write to a <i>gentleman</i>!” said Reddy
Long, starting and staring at me with a frown.
“Are you out of your wits, my neat lad? Why,
if you sent an attorney in an affair of horse-flesh,
you’d be damned in all society—you’d be out of
our list, by—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certainly,” said I, “it’s rather a small matter
to go to law about,” (mistaking his meaning).</p>

<p class='c004'>“Law! Law!” exclaimed Reddy, “Why, thunder
and oones! <i>jockeying</i> one is a personal insult
all the world over, when it’s a <i>gentleman</i> that resorts
to it, and in the house of another gentleman. No,
no; you must make him give up the <i>shiners</i>, and <i>no
questions asked</i>, or I’ll have him out ready for you
to shoot at in the meadows of Ahaboe by seven in
the morning. See here!” said he, opening his
ornamented mahogany pistol-case, “see, the boys
are as bright as silver; and I’m sure if the poor
things could speak, they’d thank you for getting
them their liberty: they have not been out of their
own house these three months.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, Reddy Long,” said I, “I vow to God I
do not want to <i>fight</i>; there’s no reason for my quarrelling
about it. Charley White will return my
money when I ask him for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That won’t do,” said Reddy: “if the horse
limps, the insult is complete; we must have no
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>bad precedents in this county. One gentleman
warranting a <i>limper</i> to another in <i>private</i> is a gross
affront, and a hole in his skin will be indispensable.
At fairs, hunts, and horse-races, indeed,
its ‘catch as catch can;’ there’s no great
dishonour as to beasts in the open air. That’s
the rule all the world over. Law, indeed! no, no,
my boy, ten guineas or death—no sort of alternative!
Tom Nolan,” continued he, looking out
of the window, “saddle the pony;—I’ll be with
Charley White of Ballybrophy before he gets
home, as sure as Ben Burton!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I tell you, Mr. Long,” said I, rather displeased,
“I tell you I don’t want to fight, and I
won’t fight. I feel no insult yet at least, and I
desire you not to deliver any such message from
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You do!” said Reddy Long, “you do!”
strutting up and looking me fiercely in the face.
“Then, if you won’t fight <i>him</i>, you’ll fight <i>me</i>,
I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why so?” said I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that to you?” said he; but in a moment
he softened and added, taking me by the
hand, “My good lad, I know you are a mere boy,
and not up to <i>the ways</i> yet; but your father would
be angry if I did not make you do yourself justice;
so come, get ready, my buck, to canter off to
Denny Cuff’s, where we’ll be more handy for to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>I persisted in desiring him not to deliver any
hostile message; but in vain. “If,” said he, as he
mounted his pony, “you won’t fight, I must fight
him myself, as the thing occurred in my house.
I’ll engage that, if you did not call out Charley,
all the bullock-feeders from Ossory, and that
double-tongued dog from Ballybrophy at the head
of them, would <i>post</i> you at the races at Roscrea.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Before I could expostulate further Mr. Reddy
Long galloped off with a <i>view holloa</i>, to deliver a
challenge for me against my will<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a> to Mr. Charley
White, who had given me no provocation. I felt
very uneasy; however, off I rode to Cuffsborough,
where I made my complaint to old Denny Cuff,
whose daughter was married to Reddy Long, and
whose son afterward married my sister.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r23'>23</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I had made an unbending rule, for which I was dreadfully
teased in the country, never to fight or quarrel about horse-flesh.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Old Cuff laughed heartily at me, and said,
“You know Charley White?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To be sure I do,” said I; “a civil and inoffensive
man as any in Ossory.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s the very reason Reddy will deliver a
challenge to him,” said Cuff.</p>

<p class='c004'>“’Tis an odd reason enough,” answered I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But a right good one too,” rejoined old
Cuff.—“Reddy knew that Charley would rather
give <i>fifty</i> yellow boys than stand <i>half</i> a shot,
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>let alone a <i>couple</i>. I’ll answer for it Reddy knows
what he is about:” and so it proved.</p>

<p class='c004'>My self-elected second returned that evening
with Charley White’s groom, to take back the
horse; and he brought me my ten guineas. On
my thanking him, and holding out my hand to
receive them, after a moment’s hesitation, he said,
“You don’t want them for a day or two, do
you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Taken completely by surprise, I answered involuntarily,
“No.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, then,” said my friend Reddy, “I am
going to the races of Roscrea, and I won’t give
you <i>the ten</i> till I come back. It’s all one to
you, you know?” added he, begging the question.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was <i>not</i> all one to me: however, I was too
proud or rather silly to gainsay him, and he put
the pieces into his purse with a number of similar
companions, and went to the races of Roscrea,
where he was soon disburdened of them all, and contracted
sundry obligations into the bargain. I was
necessitated to go home, and never saw him after.
He died very soon, and bequeathed me an excellent
chestnut hunter, called Spred, with Otter,
a water-dog of singular talents. I was well
pleased when I heard of this; but, on inquiry,
found they were <i>lapsed legacies</i>, as the horse had
died of the glanders a year before, and the dog
had run mad, and was hanged long ere the departure
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>of his master. I suppose, when death
was torturing poor Reddy, (for he died of the
gout in his head,) he forgot that the horse had
been then skinned more than a twelvemonth.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>BULLETIN EXTRAORDINARY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The author and Counsellor Moore laid by the heels at Rock House—Dismal apprehensions—A recipe and recovery—The <i>races</i> of Castlebar—The author forms a party to visit the spot—Members of the party described—Serjeant Butler and the doctor—Differences of <i>opinion</i>—The serjeant’s bulletin of the famous battle of Castlebar.</p>

<p class='c006'>After fifteen days of one of the hottest election
contests I had ever witnessed, I accompanied my
friend, Counsellor Moore, to his aunt’s, (Mrs.
Burke of Rock House, Castlebar,) where plenty,
hospitality, and the kindest attentions would have
soon made amends for our past misfortunes.—But
ill luck would not remit so suddenly:—we
had both got a Mayo <i>chill</i> on us, from the effects
whereof, not even abundance of good claret and
hot punch could protect us.</p>

<p class='c004'>We had retired to rest after a most joyous festivity,
when Moore (who had not been two hours in
bed) was roused by the excruciating tortures of an
inflammation of the stomach; and in less than half
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>an hour after I heard his first groan, I found my
own breath rapidly forsaking me; pins and needles
seemed to be darting across my chest in all directions,
and it was quite clear that another <i>inflammation</i>
had taken a fancy to <i>my lungs</i> without giving
the slightest notice. I could scarcely articulate,
though my pains were not so very great as those
of my poor friend: but I lost half the power
of respiring, and had not even the consolation of
being able to moan so loud as he. This was truly
mortifying; but I contrived to thump strongly
against the wainscot, which being hollow, proved
an excellent <i>conductor</i>. The family took for
granted that the house was on fire, or that some
thief or ghost had appeared; and, roused up by
different conjectures, its members of each sex,
age, and rank, quickly rushed into our room
screeching, and jostling each other, as they followed
the old man-servant, who, with a hatchet in
his hand, came on most valiantly. None waited
for the ceremony of the toilet; but approached
just as they had quitted their couches—not even a
“blanket” being “in the alarm of fear caught
up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The first follower of the old footman was a fat
cook of Mrs. Burke’s, Honor O’Maily, who, on
learning the cause of the uproar, immediately commenced
clearing herself from any suspicion of <i>poisoning</i>;
and cursing herself, without any reservation
as to saints and devils, if the victuals, as she
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>dressed them, were not sweet, good, and right
wholesome: her pepper and salt, she vowed, had
been in the house a fortnight before, and both
the fritters and pancakes were fried in <i>her own
drippings</i>!</p>

<p class='c004'>Honor’s exculpatory harangue being with some
difficulty silenced, a hundred antidotes were immediately
suggested: Mrs. Burke, an excellent
woman, soon found a receipt at the end of her
cookery book for curing all manner of poisons (for
they actually deemed us poisoned), either in man
or beast; and the administration of this recipe
was approved by one Mr. Dennis Shee, another
family domestic, who said “he had been <i>pysoned</i>
himself with some love-powders by a young woman
who wanted to marry him, and was cured
by the very same stuff the mistress was going
to make up for the counsellors; but that any how
he would run off for the doctor, who to be sure
knew best about the matter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was now fully agreed, that some of Denis
Brown’s voters had got the poison from a witch at
Braefield,<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a> out of spite, and all the servants cried
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>out that there was no luck or grace for any real
gentleman in that quarter from the time George
Robert was hanged.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r24'>24</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In old times, Braefield near Turlow had been noted for
witches, several of whom had been burned or drowned for poisoning
cattle, giving love-powders to people’s <i>childer</i> ere they
came to years of maturity, and bestowing the shaking ague on
every body who was not kind to them. When I was at Turlow,
they showed me near Braefield five high granite stones
stuck up in the midst of a green field, which they called “the
Witches of Braefield.” They said there was a witch under
every one of these, buried a hundred feet deep “at any rate.”</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Poor Mrs. Burke was miserable on every account,
since the story of “two counsellors being
poisoned at Rock House” would be such a stain on
the family.</p>

<p class='c004'>Being raised up in my bed against pillows, I
began to think my complaint rather <i>spasmodic</i> than
<i>inflammatory</i>, as I breathed better apace, and felt
myself almost amused by the strange scenes going
on around. Mrs. Burke had now prepared her
antidote. Oil, salt, soapsuds, honey, vinegar, and
whisky, were the principal ingredients. Of these,
well shaken up in a quart bottle, she poured part
down her nephew’s throat (he not being able to
drink it out of a bowl), much as farriers drench a
horse; and as soon as the first gulp was down,
she asked poor Moore if he felt any easier. He
answered her question only by pushing back the
antidote, another drop of which he absolutely refused
to touch. She made a second effort to
<i>drench</i> him, lest it might be <i>too late</i>; but ere any
thing more could be done, the doctor, or rather
apothecary and man-midwife, arrived, when bleeding,
blistering, &amp;c. &amp;c. were had recourse to, and
on the third day I was totally recovered; my poor
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>friend got better but slowly, and after two dangerous
relapses.</p>

<p class='c004'>The incidents which had taken place in Castlebar
during the French invasion, three years before,
were too entertaining not to be pried into (now I
was upon the spot) with all my zeal and perseverance.
The most curious of battles, which was
fought there, had always excited my curiosity; I
was anxious to discover what really caused so
whimsical a defeat. But so extremely did the
several narratives I heard vary—from the official
bulletin to the tale of the private soldier, that I
found no possible means of deciding on the truth
but by hearing every story, and <i>striking an average</i>
respecting their veracity, which plan, together with
the estimate of <i>probabilities</i>, might, perhaps, bring
me pretty near the true state of the affair. There
had certainly been a battle and flight more humorous
in their nature and result than any that had
ever before been fought or accomplished by a
British army; neither powder, ball, nor bayonet
had fair claim to the victory; but to a single true
<i>blunder</i> was attributable that curious defeat of our
pampered army—horse, foot, and artillery,—in half
an hour, by a handful of half-starved Frenchmen.
So promptly (as I heard) was it effected, that the
occurrence was immediately named—and I suppose
it still retains the appellation—“The <i>races</i> of
Castlebar.” I cannot vouch for any single piece
of information I acquired; but I can repeat some
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>of the best of it; and my readers may strike the
average as I do, and form their own conclusions on
the subject. At all events, the relation may
amuse them; and, as far as the detail of such
an event can possibly do, afford a glance at
French and Irish, civil and military, high and low,
aristocracy and plebeians:—undoubtedly proving
that, after a battle is over, it suggests the simile of
a lady after her baby is born—what was a cause of
great uneasiness soon becomes a source of great
amusement.</p>

<p class='c004'>To attain this, my laudable object, the first
thing I had to do was, as far as practicable, to
fancy myself a general; and in that capacity, to
ascertain the errors by which the battle was lost,
and the conduct of the enemy after their victory.
<i>Experientia docet</i>; and by these means I might obviate
the same disaster on any future occasion. In
pursuance of this fanciful hypothesis, my primary
step was, of course, to reconnoitre the position
occupied by our troops and those of the enemy on
that engagement; and in order to do this with
effect, I took with me a <i>very clever</i> man, a serjeant
of the Kilkenny militia, who had been trampled
over by Chapman’s heavy horse in their hurry to
get off, and left with half his bones broken, to recover
as well as he could. He afterward returned
to Castlebar, where he married, and continued to
reside. An old surgeon was likewise of our party,
who had been with the army, and had (as he informed
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>me) made a most deliberate retreat when he saw
the rout begin. He described the whole affair to me,
being, now and then, interrupted and “<i>put in</i>,” as
the corporal called it, when he was running out
of the course, or drawing the long-bow. Three
or four country fellows (who, it proved, had been
rebels), wondering what brought us three together,
joined the group; and, on the whole, I was extremely
amused.</p>

<p class='c004'>The position shown me, as originally held by
the defeated, seemed, to my poor <i>civil</i> understanding,
one of the most difficult in the world to be
routed out of. Our army was drawn up on a declivity
of steep, rugged ground, with a narrow lake
at its foot, at the right whereof was a sort of
sludge-bog, too thick to swim in, and too thin to
walk upon—snipes alone, as they said, having any
fixed residence in, or lawful claim to it. On the
other side of the lake, in front of our position, was
a hill covered with underwood, and having a winding
road down its side. In our rear was the
town of Castlebar, and divers stone walls terminated
and covered our left. None of my informants
could agree either as to the number of our
troops or cannon; they all differed even to the
extent of thousands of men, and from four to
twenty pieces of cannon. Every one of the parties,
too, gave his own account in his own way.
One of the rebels swore, that “though he had
nothing but ‘this same little switch’ (a thick cudgel)
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>in his fist, he knocked four or five troopers
off their beasts, as they were galloping over himself,
till the French gentlemen came up and <i>skivered</i>
them; and when they were once down, the
‘devil a much life’ was long left in them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Were you frightened, Mr. O’Donnell?” said
I (he told me that was his name).</p>

<p class='c004'>“By my sowl!” replied O’Donnell, who seemed
a decent sort of farmer, “if you had been in it
that same day, your honour would have had no
great objections to be out of it agin.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now,” said I, “pray, Serjeant Butler, how
came the Kilkenny to run away that day so soon
and with so little reason?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Becaize we were <i>ordered</i> to run away,” answered
the serjeant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How can you say that, serjeant?” said the
doctor. “I was myself standing bolt upright at
the left of the Kilkenny when they ran without
any order.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“O yes, indeed! to be sure, doctor!” said Serjeant
Butler; “but were you where I was when
Captain Millar the <i>aidycam</i> ordered us off in no
time?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He did not,” replied the doctor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, then, since you make me curse, by J—s
he <i>did</i>; becaize the officers afterward all said, that
when he ordered us off, he forgot half what he
had to say to us.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>“And pray, what was the other half, serjeant?”
inquired I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah, then, I’ll tell you that, counsellor,” replied
Butler. “That same <i>aidycam</i> was a fat,
bloated gentleman, and they said he was rather
thick-winded like a beast, when his mind was not
easy: so he comes up (my lord was looking at the
fight, and did not mind him), and he kept puffing
and blowing away while he was ordering us,
till he came to the words, ‘you’ll get off,’ or
‘you’ll advance backwards,’ or some words of
the same kind, I can’t exactly say what;—but it
seems, when he desired us to make off, he forgot
to say ‘thirty yards,’ as the officers told us at
Tuam was the general’s word of command:—and
as he desired us to <i>make off</i>, but didn’t order us
when to <i>stop</i>, by my sowl some of us never stopped
or stayed for thirty good <i>miles</i>, and long miles too,
only to get a drink of water or halt a noggin of
whisky, if there was any in the alehouse. And
sorry enough we were, and sore likewise!—Then
there was that Chapman and his heavy horse;
troth I believe every horse in the place cantered
over us as if we were sods of turf. Bad luck to
their sowls! many a poor Kilkenny lad couldn’t
get out of their way while <i>they</i> were making off,
and so they tumbled over the Kilkenny themselves,
and all were tumbling and rolling together,
and the French were coming on to stick us; and
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>we were trampled and flattened in the dust, so
that you’d hardly know a corpse from a sheet of
brown paper, only for the red coat upon it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor now attempted to tell the story in
<i>his</i> way, when the Kilkenny serjeant, being at
length a little provoked at the other’s numerous interruptions
and contradictions, exclaimed, “Arrah!
doctor, be <i>asy</i>; it’s I can tell the counsellor, for
it’s I that was <i>in it</i>, and almost <i>kilt</i> too; and
that’s more than you were, barring with the
<i>fright</i>!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor gave him a look of sovereign contempt,
and me a significant wink, as much as to
say, “the fellow is mad, and drunk into the
bargain.”</p>

<p class='c004'>However, the serjeant conquered all opposition,
and proceeded to give me the full narrative, in
his own dialect. “Counsellor,” said he, “do
you know that Chapman—so I think they called
him—is as tall as any May-pole?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well,” said I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said the serjeant, “on the spot near
the bog, where the devil could not get at us
without drying it first and foremost—there we
were drawn up at first, all so neat and tight on
the ridge there, one would think us like iron rails,
every lad of us. Very well; being firm and fast
as aforesaid on the ridge, with the shaking bog by
the side of <i>the Chapman’s</i>—bad cess to them,
man and beast!—Oh! it was not most agreeable
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>when the French let fly at us without giving us
the least notice in life; and by my sowl, they hit
some of the boys of our regiment, and that same
set them a roaring and calling for a drink of water
and the doctor! but the devil a doctor was <i>in it</i>;
(can you deny that same?) and his honour, Lord
Ormond, our colonel, grew red in the face with
anger, or something or other, when he heard the
boys bawling for <i>water</i>, and good reason they had,
for by my sowl they were <i>kilt</i> sure enuff. So we
leathered at the French across the water, and the
French leathered at us likewise. Devil such a
<i>cracking</i> ever you heard, counsellor, as on that
day; and by the same token it would make
a dog laugh to see how Captain Shortall with his
cannons let fly at the French out of the bushes;
and by my sowl, <i>they</i> were not idle either! So,
we were all fighting mighty well, as I heard General
Lake say in the rear of us; and as I looked
round and took off my cap to hurra, I heard the
devils roar at my elbow, and saw my poor comrade,
Ned Dougherty, staggering back for all the
world just as if he was drunk, and the devil a
nose on his face any more than on the back of my
hand, counsellor, the present minute: and on a
second glance at poor Ned, I saw one of his eyes
not a whit better off than his nose;—so I called as
loud as I could for a doctor, but the devil a one
showed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor could stand the imputation no longer,
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>and immediately gave the retort not courteous to
the serjeant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, then, do you hear that?” said the serjeant,
quite coolly. “Arrah! now, how can you
say you were <i>in it</i>? When Ned Dougherty was
<i>kilt</i>, you know you were sitting <i>behind</i> the cannon;
and the devil a bit of you would have been seen
while the powder was going, if the nose was off
the <i>general</i>, let alone Ned Dougherty.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I feared much that my whole inquiries would
be frustrated by the increase of this dispute, when
one of the country fellows who was by, said,
“You’re right enuff, serjeant. It was myself and
two boys more, after yees all ran away, that
pulled the doctor from under a cart; but we let
him go, becaize he towld us he had ten <i>childer</i>
and a wife, who would crack her heart if she
thought he was slaughtered;—and that’s the truth,
and nothing else—though the devil a wife or child
ever ye had, doctor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I now winked at the doctor not to mind the
fellows, and requested the serjeant to go on with
<i>the battle</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And welcome, counsellor,” said he: “stay,
where did I leave off? O! ay, at Ned Dougherty’s
nose:—very well, poor Ned wasn’t kilt <i>dead</i>; only
lost his nose and eye, and is very comfortable
now, as he says, in Kilmainham. Very well, as
I was saying, we went on slashing away like devils
across the water, when, by my sowl, I heard some
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>cracks up at the left of us, and the balls began
to whiz all across us, lengthways. ‘What the
deuce is this job?’ says I. ‘D—mme if I know,’
said the serjeant-major;—when Captain Millar,
the general’s <i>aidycam</i>, comes up full pelt, and
orders us to <i>get off</i> as aforesaid. When we
heard that same order, we thought we were fairly
beat; and so, losing no time, set off as hard as
we could to get into Castlebar town again ere the
French could take it before us. And then, Chapman’s
people, bad chance to them, cried out, ‘Get
on! get on!’ and galloped away as if the devil was
under their tails, and no more minded <i>the Kilkenny</i>
than if we were Norway rats, trampling us up and
down, and some of them tumbling over our carcases.
You’d think it was a race-course: my ribs
were all knocked in, and my collar-bone broken;
and—and—that’s all I know, counsellor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is that <i>all</i>, serjeant?” asked I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“O no, counsellor,” replied he. “I have
more to tell, now I think of it. Every boy in our
regiment declared, if it had been Hutchinson that
commanded us, the devil a one would run away if
he stayed till this time, or go to the French either;
but all the lads used to say afterward, ‘Why should
we fight under Lake, (whom we neither knew nor
cared to know,) when we had our own brave country
general to the fore, that we’d stick by till
death?’ and I forgot to tell you, counsellor—a
hundred or so of our boys who could not run fast,
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>thought it better to stay quiet and easy with the
French than be murdered without the least reason
imaginable; and so they stayed and were treated
very handsome: only owld Corney hanged a good
many of the poor boys at Ballynamuck; and the
devil a bit better is Ireland made by hanging any
body—and that’s the truth, and nothing else!
Faith, if they hanged a quarter of us all, another
quarter would be wanting it against the next assizes.
So, what use is hanging the boys? Little
good will it ever do the remainder!”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>BREAKFASTS AT BALLINROBE.</h2>

<p class='c011'>Election for County Mayo—Author and Counsellor Moore at Ballinrobe—Mr. Dan Martin’s “little paved parlour”—Preparations for a festive breakfast—A formidable incursion—Counsellor Moore laid prostrate—Advance of the foe—The two barristers take up an elevated position—Disappearance of the various eatables—General alarm—Dislodgment of the enemy—Mr. Dan Martin’s comments upon the “affair”—<i>Secrets</i> worth Knowing—All’s Well that Ends Well.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following is almost too trifling an anecdote
to be recorded; but, as it characterises place,
time, and people, and is besides of a novel description,
I cannot deny myself the pleasure of
relating it. The period at which it occurred was
that of the Mayo election alluded to in the last
sketch.</p>

<p class='c004'>After some days of hard labour, bad food,
worse wine, and no tranquillity, Mr. Martin (I
think that was his name), the owner of an alehouse
in our interest, told us with great glee, he
had got in a few loaves of good white bread and a
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>paper of tea from Castlebar, fit for the chancellor—together
with fresh eggs and new milk; and
that if we would vouchsafe to put up with his own
“little paved parlour,” we should have a roaring
fire, capital buttered toast, and, in short, every
thing to our satisfaction, one meal <i>any how</i>; it was
God’s curse and a thousand pities he had nothing
better for the “dear counsellors;” but there was to
be a fine slip of a pig killed in the town that night
by a friend of his own, and we might have a beautiful
griskin next morning broiled to our liking.</p>

<p class='c004'>My friend Moore and I were delighted at the
announcement of a comfortable breakfast (for
some time a stranger to us), and immediately went
into the little paved parlour, where every thing
was soon in full array according to Mr. Daniel
Martin’s promises. The turf fire glowed fit to
roast an ox; abundance of hot buttered toast was
quickly placed before it; plenty of new-laid eggs
appeared—some boiled, some poached; a large
saucepan with hot water was bubbling on the
ashes; our tea was made (as the tea-pot leaked)
in a potsheen-jug; and every thing appeared in
the most proper state to <i>feast</i> two lately <i>half-fed</i>
Dublin barristers (as they called us). My mouth
watered, Moore licked his lips, and we never sat
down to the sensual enjoyment of the palate with
more <i>goût</i> or satisfaction than in Mr. Martin’s
“little paved parlour.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It seemed as if nothing short of an earthquake
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>(perhaps not even that) could have disappointed
us. But I do not recollect any incident during a
long life so completely verifying the old aphorism
of “Many a slip between the cup and the lip.”
During our happy state of anticipation, rather a
loud rap was heard:—I was just in the act of
cracking the shell of an egg, with my back to the
door, and cried out, “Come in! come in!” Nobody
entered; but another and still louder rap succeeded.
My friend, not being at that instant so
busily occupied as I, stepped to the door, with
the purpose of telling whoever it might be to
“call again” in half an hour. I meanwhile proceeded
with my egg; when I heard Moore, who
was not in the habit of using imprecations, cry out
piteously, “Oh! blood and oons!” and his exclamation
was accompanied by a crash that alarmed
me. On turning rapidly round, to aid him in any
possible emergency, I saw my companion extended
on the floor, his heels kicked up in the air, and
eight or ten young <i>pigs</i> making the best of their
way over the counsellor’s prostrate body with
great vivacity. Their <i>mother</i>, with divers deep
and savage grunts, snorting, and catching the air
through her enormous proboscis, took her way
round the other side of the room, and effectually
cut us off both from the door and our weapons on
the breakfast-table. This manœuvre certainly
would have daunted much greater heroes than
either of us pretended to be; and I doubt if there
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>is a field-marshal in the service either of his Britannic
or Most Christian Majesty who would have
felt himself quite at ease under similar circumstances.</p>

<p class='c004'>We had no retreat: the foe had anticipated us,
and appeared both able and willing to slaughter
us for the sake of her progeny. “Mount, Moore,”
said I. He limped, for his leg was hurt, to a high
old-fashioned chest of drawers, which fortunately
stood in a corner. Upon these drawers each of
us got, and thence watched ulterior operations,
but by no means considering ourselves <i>out of danger</i>
from so <i>frightful</i> an enemy.</p>

<p class='c004'>That the reader who has not been accustomed
to associate with swine at Ballinrobe may form a
just idea of our situation, he shall be made accurately
acquainted with the species of lady visitor
we had to deal with. The eight or ten <i>childer</i>
were what we call “piggin riggins,” too old for
a dainty and too young for bacon—the “<i>hobble-de-hoys</i>”
of swinehood. Their mother literally
“towered above her sex,” and was the lankiest
and most bristly sow I ever beheld. Her high
arched back, taller than a donkey’s, springing
from the abutments of her loins and shoulders,
resembled a coarse rustic bridge; her dangling
teats swept the ground; long loose flabby ears
nearly concealed a pair of small fiery blood-shot
sunken eyes, and their ends just covered one
half of a mouth which, dividing her head as it
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>were into an upper and under story, clearly
showed that she had the means of taking what
bite she pleased out of any thing. Her tusks,
indeed, like a boar’s, peeped under her broad and
undulating nostrils, which were decorated with
an iron ring and hook, that appeared to afford the
double power of defending the wearer against assaults
and hooking in an enemy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of such a description was the family that paid
us this unwelcome visit, demonstrating thereby
the uncertainty of all sublunary expectations. The
fact was, that the lady, with ten of her <i>childer</i>,
had been wallowing in the quagmire by the side
of our parlour-window, which we had opened to
give a part of the captive smoke an opportunity of
escaping—but which at the same time let out the
savoury perfume of our repast; this entering
piggy’s sensitive nostrils, she was roused to action,
and, grunting to her family as a trumpeter
sounds “to horse,” they made their way to the
well-known door of the little paved parlour, which
finding closed (a very unusual circumstance),
madam’s temper was somewhat ruffled, and the
catastrophe ensued. Ceremony from a sow, under
such circumstances, could not be reasonably looked
for, and any delay in disposing of our luxuries
was still less to be expected. In her haste to accomplish
that achievement, she had on gaining
admittance run between the legs of Counsellor
Thomas Moore, and, as on an inclined plane, she
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>first raised, then deposited him upon the pavement;
and leaving him to the discretion of her
<i>piggin riggins</i>, changed her own course to our
breakfast-table, which having duly overset, the
whole was at her mercy—of which, however, she
showed none;—the toast, the bread, the eggs—in
short, <i>every thing</i>, disappearing in marvellous
quick time.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two counsellors, from their elevated position,
beheld the destruction of all these comforts,
and congratulated themselves on the good
luck of being personally out of danger: but here
also we “reckoned without our host:” we entertained
no doubt of madam sow’s peaceable departure,
and did not wish to expose ourselves
to the ridicule of being discovered perched upon a
chest of drawers. One of the <i>piggins</i>, however,
not content with the prey he had already got,
in roaming about for more, and unaccustomed to
boiling water, happened to overset the large saucepan
which was steaming upon the hob, and
which descended full on his unseasoned hide.
Hereupon, feeling his tender bristles getting
loose, and at the first scratch coming away with
a due quantity of scarf-skin to keep them together,
he set up the most dreadful cries I ever
heard, even from the most obstinate of his race
when the butcher was taking the preliminary
steps towards manufacturing corned pork—that
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>comrade of pease-pudding, and glory of the British
navy!</p>

<p class='c004'>The <i>mamma</i> of course attributed the cries of her
darling to some torture inflicted by the <i>Christians</i>
upon the drawers; to the foot of which she therefore
trotted, and with deep and loud grunts looked
up at us, opening her wide jaws, and seeming to
say, “I wish I had you both down here, and my
dear little <i>piggin riggins</i> should soon be revenged
for your cruelty!” I thought that, once or twice,
she appeared disposed to try if she could balance
her body on her hind-legs and rear up against the
chest of drawers; in which case, even if her jaws
did not clearly take hold of us, the strong iron
hook in her nose would be sure to catch and hawl
down one or other by the leg—as, if once hooked,
it would only be a trial of strength between the
sow’s snout and the tendon Achilles of either
counsellor. We could not kick at her for fear
of the same hook; so we kept dancing and stamping,
to try if that would deter her. But she was
too much bent on mischief to care for our defensive
operations; and we were ultimately obliged
to resort to that step generally taken by people
when they find themselves failing in point of
fortitude, and manfully cried out—“Murder!
murder!” But as no one came, Moore said they
were so used to <i>that</i> cry in Ballinrobe (and particularly
in the “little paved parlour”), that the
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>people never minded it; so we changed our tone,
and roared “Fire! fire!”</p>

<p class='c004'>In a second the entire population of the house
was in the room, when an <i>éclaircissement</i> took place.
Still, however, the <i>lady</i> would not beat a retreat:—sticks,
flails, handles of rakes, and pitchforks,
belaboured her in vain; she minded them no more
than straws. At length, they seized hold of her
<i>tail</i>:—this action seemed to make her imagine
that it was desired to <i>detain</i> her <i>in</i> the room; upon
which, that spirit of contradiction inherent in more
animals than one, determined her to <i>go out</i>. She
accordingly rushed off, followed by the whole
brood, and we saw no more of her or her hopeful
family.</p>

<p class='c004'>After they were gone, it took Mr. Martin above
five minutes to lavish on the sow and <i>piggin riggins</i>
every imprecation his vocabulary could furnish;
and he concluded thus:—“Ough! May
the curse of Crummell light on yee, for a greedy
owld sow as you are! yee need not have taken
such trouble to cater for your <i>childer</i>. If they had
just peeped up the chimney, they’d have seen their
<i>father</i> as well dried and smoked as any boar that
ever was <i>kilt</i> in Ballinrobe these two years, any
how; and by my sowl I expect to have six of the
<i>childer</i> along with him by next Michaelmas, at
latest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>All being now arranged, we begged Mr. Martin
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>to replenish our board as quickly as possible.
Daniel, however, looked grave and chop-fallen,
and in two monosyllables apprised us of the extent
of our misfortunes. “I can’t,” said he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why?” we both asked in a breath.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, holy poker!” exclaimed Mr. Dan Martin,
“what shall I do to feed yee, counsellors
dear! By my sowl, Sir Neil will <i>skiver</i> me!
Devil a bit or sup more I have in this same house.
Arrah! Mary! Mary!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that, avourneen?” said Mary, entering.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What have you in the house, Mary?” demanded
the landlord.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ough! the devil a taste was left from the
Newport voters, barring what we kept for the
counsellors.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And have you literally <i>nothing</i>, Mr. Martin?”
demanded we.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All as one,” was the reply. “Sir Neil’s men
got the last of the meat; and a minute or two
ago, who should come in—devil’s cure to him!
but Denis Brown Sallough’s body-sarvant, and
pretended, the villain, that he was Sir Neil’s
man; and he bought all the rest of the bread and
tay for ready money. If I had thought, counsellors,
of the incivility my sow put on yees—bad
luck to her sowl, egg and bird!—I’d have seen
Denis Brown Sallough’s body-sarvant <i>carded</i> like
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>a tithe proctor<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a> before I’d have sold him as much
as would fill a hollow tooth—and by my sowl he
has plenty of <i>them</i>, counsellors dear!”</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f25'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r25'>25</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Carding</i> the tithe proctors (who certainly were the genuine
tyrants of Ireland) was occasionally resorted to by the White
Boys, and was performed in the following manner.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tithe proctor was generally waked out of his first sleep
by his door being smashed in; and the <i>boys</i> in white shirts
desired him “never to fear,” as they only intended to <i>card</i> him
this bout for taking a quarter instead of a tenth from every poor
man in the parish. They then turned him on his face upon the
bed; and taking a lively ram cat out of a bag which they
brought with them, they set the cat between the proctor’s shoulders.
The beast, being nearly as much terrified as the proctor,
would endeavour to get off; but being held fast by the tail, he
intrenched every claw deep in the proctor’s back, in order to
keep up a firm resistance to the White Boys. The more the tail
was pulled <i>back</i>, the more the ram cat tried to go <i>forward</i>; at
length, when he had, as he conceived, made his possession quite
secure, main force convinced him to the contrary, and that if he
kept his hold he must lose his tail. So, he was dragged backward
to the proctor’s loins, grappling at every pull, and bringing
away here and there strips of the proctor’s skin, to prove
the pertinacity of his defence.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the ram cat had got down to the loins he was once more
placed at the shoulders, and again <i>carded</i> the proctor (<i>toties
quoties</i>) according to his sentence.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>“Have you no eggs, Mr. Martin?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, plase your honour, it’s not two hours
since the high sheriff’s cook (as he called himself)
came and took every cock and hen I had in the
world (he paid like a gentleman, to be sure), for he
has a great dinner to-day, and being disappointed
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>of poultry, he <i>kilt</i> every mother’s babe of mine,
gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have milk?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d have plenty of that stuff, counsellors,
only (oh my poor cow, and the three heifers!)
Sir Neil’s voters are generally so <i>dry</i>, and by my
sowl, I believe not far from <i>hungry</i> either, that
they, five or six times a day if they can, get a
drink out of the poor animals. They have been
milked, indeed, till their teats are raw, gentlemen,
and that’s the truth, and nothing else but the
<i>true truth</i>.” Recollecting himself, however, he
added—“But, counsellors, dear, if your honours
can put up with <i>our own</i> little breakfast, you’ll be
more welcome nor the flowers of May, and there
will be plenty of that, gentlemen, such as it is,
and I’ll tell you <i>what</i> it is. First and foremost,
there’s no better than the apple pratees, and they
are ready hot and smothering for ourselves and
that d——’d sow and her <i>childer</i>, and be cursed to
them! but the devil a one they will get this day,
for affronting yees, gentlemen!—And next to the
pratees, there’s the potsheen. I <i>still’d</i> it myself
a year ago, and hid it under ground when the
elections came on; but I get a bottle or two out
always. And then, gentlemen, I can broil for you
(but that’s a secret, plase your honours,) a few
beautiful rashers out of the two flitches I have
hid on a little shelf up the chimney for fear of the
two-guinea freeholders;—it’s more like clear horn
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>nor bacon, counsellors dear,” pursued he, hauling
down a side of it as he spoke, and cutting out
several large rashers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose,” said I, “this is some of your
good sow’s family;—if so, I shall have great pleasure
in paying her off in her own style?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, then, counsellor,” said Mr. Martin,
laughing and rubbing his hands—“you are the
very devil at finding out things!—ha! ha!—By my
sowl, it is a <i>sister</i> of the said sow’s, sure enuff—bad
luck to the whole breed for eating the buttered
toast this blessed morning!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The result was, that we got rashers, potatoes,
and potsheen, for our breakfast; at the end of
which Mr. Martin brought in a jug of capital
home-brewed ale;—and the possession of this, also,
he said was a secret, or the gauger would play
the deuce with him. We fared, in a word, very
well; I much doubt, to speak truth, if it were not
a more appropriate meal for a desperate bad day
and much hard work than a lady’s teapot would
afford; and, in pursuance of this notion, I had a
rasher, potatoe, and draught of good ale, every
day afterward during my stay at that abominable
election.</p>

<p class='c004'>English people would hardly credit the circumstances
attending an electioneering contest in Ireland,
so late as twenty-three years ago. Little
attention was then paid by the country gentlemen
to their several assize towns; and there was not
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>a single respectable inn at Ballinrobe. Somebody
indeed had built the shell of an hotel; but it had
not been plastered either within or without, or
honoured by any species of furniture: it had not
indeed even banisters to the stairs.</p>

<p class='c004'>Perhaps the time of year and desperate state of
the weather (uncheckered by one ray of sunshine)
tended to disgust me with the place: but I certainly
never in my lifetime was so annoyed as at
the election of Ballinrobe, though every thing that
could possibly be done for our comfort <i>was</i> done
by Sir John Brown—than whom I never met any
gentleman more friendly or liberal.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>NEW MODE OF SERVING A PROCESS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The author at Rock House—Galway election—<i>Searching</i> for voters—Mr. Ned Bodkin—Interesting conversation between him and the author—Process-serving at Connemara—Burke, the bailiff—His hard treatment—Irish method of discussing a chancery bill—Ned Bodkin’s “Lament”—False oaths, and their disastrous consequences—Country magistrates in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c006'>The election for County Galway was proceeding
whilst I was refreshing myself at Rock House,
Castlebar, after various adventures at Ballinrobe—as
already mentioned. I met at Rock House an
old fellow who told me his name was Ned Bodkin,
a Connemara boy; and that he had come with
two or three other lads only to <i>search</i> for voters to
take to Galway for Squire Martin’s poll. Bodkin
came to Mrs. Burke’s house to consult Counsellor
Moore, and I determined to have a full conversation
with him as to the peninsula of Connemara
and its statistics. He sent off eight or nine freeholders
(such as they were) in eight-and-forty
hours; they were soon polled for the squire, and
came back as happy as possible.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>I asked Mr. Bodkin where he lived.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah! then where should it be but at Connemara?”
said he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what’s your trade or calling, when you’re
at home, Mr. Bodkin?” inquired I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, plase your honour, no poor man could
live upon one calling now-a-days as we did in
owld times, or no calling at all, as when the squire
was <i>in it</i>. Now I butchers a trifle, your honour!
and burns the kelp when I’m entirely idle. Then I
take a touch now and then at the still, and smuggle
a few in Sir Neil’s cutter when the coast is clear.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Any thing else, Mr. Bodkin?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ough yes, your honour; ’tis me that tans
the brogue leather for the colonel’s yeomen: (God
bless them!) besides, I’m bailiff-bum of the town
lands, and make out our election registries; and
when I’ve nothing else to do, I keep the squire’s
accounts: and by my sowl that same is no asy
matter, plase your honour, till one’s used to it! but,
God bless him, up and down, wherever he goes,
here or hereafter! he’s nothing else but a good
master to us all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Ned Bodkin,” continued I, “every body
says the king’s writ does not <i>run</i> in Connemara?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ough! then whoever towld your honour that
is a big liar. By my sowl, when the King
George’s writ (crossing himself) comes within
smell of the big house, the boys soon make
him run as if the seven red devils was under his
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>tail, saving your presence. It’s King George’s
writ that <i>does run</i> at Connemara, plase your worship,
all as one as a black greyhound. O the
devil a stop he stays till he gets into the court-house
of Galway again!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Bodkin talked allegorically, so I continued
in the same vein:—“And pray if you catch the
king’s writ, what do you do then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Plase your honour, that story is asy towld.
<i>Do</i>, is it? I’ll tell your honour that. Why, if
the <i>prossy-sarver</i> is <i>cotched</i> in the territories of
Ballynahinch, by my sowl if the squire’s not <i>in it</i>,
he’ll either eat his parchments every taste, or go
down into the owld coal-pit sure enuff, whichever
is most <i>agreeable</i> to the said prossy-sarver.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I suppose he generally prefers eating
his parchments?” said I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your honour’s right enuff,” replied Mr. Bodkin.
“The <i>varment</i> generally gulps it down
mighty glib; and, by the same token, he is seldom
or ever obstrepulous enuff to go down into the said
coal-pit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“<i>Dry</i> food, Mr. Bodkin,” said I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ough! by no manner of manes, your honour.
We always give the prossy-sarver, poor crethur!
plenty to moisten his said food with and wash
it down well, any how; and he goes back to the
’sizes as merry as a water-dog, and swears (God
forgive him!) that he was <i>kilt</i> at Connemara by
people unknown; becaize if he didn’t do that, he
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>knows well enuff he’d soon be kilt dead by people
he did know, and that’s the truth, plase your
honour, and nothing else.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Does it often happen, Mr. Bodkin?” said I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ough! plase your honour, only that our own
bailiffs and yeomen soldiers keep the sheriffs’
officers out of Connemara, we’d have a rookery
of them afore every ’sizes and sessions, when
the master’s amongst the Sassanachs in London
city. We made one lad, when the master was
in said foreign parts, eat every taste of what
he towld us was a chancellor’s bill, that he
brought from Dublin town to sarve in our quarter.
We laid in ambush, your honour, and cotched him
on the bridge; but we did not throw him over
that, though we made believe that we would.
‘We have you, you villain!’ said I. ‘Spare
my life!’ says he. ‘What for?’ said I. ‘Oh!
give me marcy!’ says the sarver. ‘The devil a
taste,’ said I. ‘I’ve nothing but a chancellor’s
bill,’ said he. ‘Out with it,’ says I. So he
ups, and outs with his parchment, plase your
honour:—by my sowl, then, there was plenty of
that same!</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘And pray, what name do you go by when
you are at home?’ said I. ‘Oh then, don’t you
know Burke the <i>bum</i>?’ said he. ‘Are you satisfied
to <i>eat</i> it, Mr. Burke?’ said I. ‘If I was as
hungry as twenty hawks, I could not eat it all in
less than a fortnight any how,’ said the sarver,
‘it’s so long and crisp.’ ‘Never fear,’ said I.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>“‘Why shu’dn’t I fear?’ said he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘What’s that to you?’ said I. ‘Open your
mouth, and take a bite, if you plase.’ ‘Spare my
life!’ said he. ‘Take a bite, if you plase, Mr.
Burke,’ again said I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So he took a bite, plase your honour; but I
saw fairly it was too dry and tough for common
eating, so I and the rest of <i>the boys</i> brought the
bum to my little cabin, and we soaked <i>the chancellor</i>
in potsheen in my little keg, and I towld
him he should stay his own time till he eat it
all as soon as it was <i>tinder</i>, and at three meals a
day, with every other little nourishment we could
give the crethur. So he stayed very agreeable till
he had finished the chancellor’s bill every taste,
and was drunk with it every day twice, at any
rate; and then I towld him he might go back to
Galway town and welcome. But he said he’d got
kinder treatment and better liquor nor ever the
villain of a sub-sheriff gave any poor fellow, and
if I’d let him, he’d fain stay another day or two to
bid us good bye. ‘So, Mary,’ said I to the
woman my wife, ‘’commodate the poor officer a
day or two more to bid us good bye.’—‘He’s
kindly welcome,’ says she. So Burke stayed till
the ’sizes was over, and then swore he lay for
dead on the road-side, and did not know what
became of the chancellor’s bill, or where it was
deposited at said time. I had towld him, your
honour, I’d make good his oath for him; and,
accordingly, we made him so drunk, that he lay
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>all as one as a dead man in the ditch till we
brought him home, and then he said he could kiss
the holy ’pistle and gospel safe in the court-house,
that he lay for dead in a ditch by reason of
the treatment he got at Connemara; and Mr.
Burke turned out a good fellow; and the devil a
prossy-sarver ever came into Connemara for a
year after, but he sent a gossoon aforehand to tell
us where we’d cotch the sarver afore sarvice. Oh!
God rest your sowl, Bum Burke, and deliver
it safe! it’s us that were sorry enuff when we
heard the horse kilt you dead—oh bad cess to him!
the likes of ye didn’t come since to our quarter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This mode of making process-servers <i>eat</i> the
process was not at all confined to Connemara. I
have myself known it practised often at the colliery
of Doonan, the estate of my friend Hartpole,
when his father Squire Robert was alive. It was
quite the custom; and if a person in those times
took his residence in the purlieus of that colliery,
serving him with any legal process was entirely
out of the question; for if a bailiff attempted it, he
was sure to have either a meal of sheepskin or a
dive in a coal-pit, for his trouble.</p>

<p class='c004'>This species of outrage was, however, productive
of greater evil than merely making the process-server
eat his bill. Those whose business it
was to serve processes in time against the assizes,
being afraid to fulfil their missions, took a short
cut, and swore they <i>had</i> actually served them,
though they had never been on the spot;—whereby
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>many a judgment was obtained surreptitiously,
and executed on default upon parties who
had never heard one word of the business:—and
thus whole families were ruined by the perjury of
one process-server.</p>

<p class='c004'>The magistrates were all country gentlemen,
very few of whom had the least idea of law proceedings
further than when they happened to be
directed against themselves; and the common
fellows, when sworn on the holy Evangelists, conceived
they could outwit the magistrates by kissing
their own thumb, which held the book, instead
of the cover of it; or by swearing, “By the vartue
of my oath it’s through (true), your worship!”
(putting a finger through a button-hole.)</p>

<p class='c004'>So numerous were the curious acts and anecdotes
of the Irish magistrates of those days, that
were I to recite many of them, the matter-of-fact
English (who have no idea of Irish freaks of this
nature) would, I have no doubt, set me down as a
complete romancer.</p>

<p class='c004'>I conceived it would much facilitate the gratification
of my desire to learn the customs of the
Irish magisterial justices by becoming one myself.
I therefore took out my <i>didimus</i> at once for <i>every</i>
county in Ireland; and being thus a magistrate for
thirty-two counties, I of course, wherever I went,
learned all their doings; and I believe no body of
men ever united more <i>authority</i> and less <i>law</i> than
did the Irish justices of thirty years since.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fair of Donnybrook, near Dublin, has been
long identified with the name and character of the
lower classes of Irish people; and so far as the
population of its metropolis may fairly stand for
that of a whole country, the identification is just.
This remark applies, it is true, to several years
back; as that entire revolution in the natural Irish
character, which has taken place within my time,
must have extended to all their sports and places
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>of amusement; and Donnybrook fair, of course,
has had its full share in the metamorphosis.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <i>old</i> Donnybrook fair, however, is on record;
and so long as the name exists, will be duly
appreciated. Mr. Lysight’s popular song of “The
Sprig of Shillelah and Shamrock so Green,”<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a> gives
a most lively sketch of that celebrated meeting—some
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>of the varieties and peculiarities of which
may be amusing, and will certainly give a tolerable
idea of the Dublin commonalty in the eighteenth
century.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r26'>26</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two lines of Mr. Lysight’s song describe, quaintly, yet veritably,
the practical <i>point</i> of the scenes which occurred at that
place of licensed eccentricities. He speaks of the real Irish
Paddy, who</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Steps into a tent, just to spend half-a-crown,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Slips out, meets a <i>friend</i>, and for <i>joy</i> knocks him down!</div>
      <div class='line in6'>With his sprig of shillelah and shamrock so green.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It is a literal fact that the blow is as instantly forgiven, and the
twain set a-drinking together in great harmony, as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p class='c004'>A priest constantly attended in former times at an alehouse
near Kilmainham, to marry any couples who may have agreed
upon that ceremony when they were <i>drunk</i>, and made up their
minds for its immediate celebration so soon as they should be
sober: and after the ceremony he sent them back to the fair for
one more drink; and the lady then went home an <i>honest</i> woman,
and as happy as possible. Many hundred similar matches used, in
old times, to be effected during this carnival. Mr. Lysight also
describes the happy consequences of such weddings with infinite
humour. He says of the ulterior increase of each family</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>“and nine months after that</div>
      <div class='line'>A fine boy cries out, ‘How do ye do, Father Pat?</div>
      <div class='line in4'>With your sprig of shillelah and shamrock so green.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>This system may somewhat account for the “alarming population
of Ireland,” as statesmen now call it.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>All Ireland is acquainted with the sort of sports
and recreations which characterise Donnybrook.
But the English, in general, are as ignorant of
an Irish fair as they are of every other matter respecting
the “sister kingdom,” and that is saying
a great deal. John Bull, being the most egotistical
animal of the creation, measures every man’s
coat according to his own cloth, and fancying an
Irish mob to be like a London rabble, thinks that
Donnybrook fair is composed of all the vice, robbery,
swindling, and spectacle—together with still
rougher manners of its own—of his dear St.
Bartholomew.</p>

<p class='c004'>Never was John more mistaken. I do not know any
one trait of character conspicuous alike in himself
and brother Pat, save that which is their common
disgrace and incentive to all other vices, <i>drinking</i>;
and even in drunkenness the English far surpass
Pat—though perhaps their superiority in this respect
may be attributable merely to their being
better able to purchase the poison; and if they
have <i>not</i> the means ready, they are far more expert
at picking of pockets, burglary, or murder, to
procure them—as Mr. <i>John Ketch</i> (operative at
his majesty’s gaol of Newgate in London) can
bear ample testimony.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>There is no doubt but all mobs are tumultuous,
violent, and more or less savage (no matter
what they meet about): it is the nature of democratic
congregations so to be. Those of England
are thoroughly wicked, and, when roused, most
ferocious; but they show little genuine courage,
and a few soldiers by a shot or two generally send
thousands of fellows scampering, to adjourn <i>sine die</i>.
Formerly, I never saw an Irish mob that could not
easily be rendered tractable and complacent by
persons who, as they conceived, intended them
fairly and meant to act kindly by them. So much
waggery and fun ever mingled with their most
riotous adventures, that they were not unfrequently
dispersed by a good-humoured joke, when
it would probably have required a regiment and
the reading of a dozen riot acts to do it by compulsion.</p>

<p class='c004'>A long, erroneous system of ruling that people
seems to have gradually, and at length definitively,
changed the nature of the Irish character
in every class and branch of the natives, and
turned into political agitation what I remember
only a taste for simple hubbub. The Irish have
an indigenous <i>goût</i> for fighting, (of which they
never can be divested,) quite incomprehensible to a
sober English farmer, whose food and <i>handiwork</i> are
as regular as his clock. At Donnybrook, the scene
had formerly no reservation as to the full exhibition
of genuine Hibernian character; and a description
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>of one of the <i>tents</i> of that celebrated sporting
fair will answer nearly for all of them, and likewise
give a tolerable idea of most other fairs in the
Emerald island at the same period. Having twice<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a>
run a narrow risk of losing my life at Donnybrook,
(the last time at its fair in 1790,) I am entitled
to remember its localities at least as well as
any gentleman who never was in danger of ending
his days there.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r27'>27</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For the first of these occurrences see (Vol. ii.) my adventure
with Counsellor Daly and Balloon Crosby.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>The site of the fair is a green flat of no great
extent, about a mile from Dublin city, and on the
banks of a very shallow stream that runs dribbling
under a high bridge:—fancy irregular houses on
one side, and a highroad through the middle, and
you will have a pretty good idea of that plain of
festivity.</p>

<p class='c004'>Many and of various proportions were the tents
which, in time past, composed the encampment
upon the plains of Donnybrook; and if persevering
turbulence on the part of the Emeralders should
ever put it into the heads of the members of his
majesty’s government to hire a few bands of
<i>Cossacks</i> to keep them in order, (and I really believe
they are the only folks upon earth who
could frighten my countrymen,) the model of a
Donnybrook tent will be of great service to the
Don-Russian auxiliaries—the materials being so
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>handy and the erection so <i>facile</i>. I shall therefore
describe one accurately, that the Emperor Nicholas
and his brother Michael, who has seen something
of Ireland already, may, upon any such treaty
being signed, perceive how extremely well his
Imperial Majesty’s Tartars will be accommodated.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Receipt for a Donnybrook Tent.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>Take eight or ten long wattles, or any indefinite
number, according to the length you wish
your tent to be (whether two yards, or half a mile,
makes no difference as regards the architecture or
construction). Wattles need not be provided by
purchase and sale, but may be readily procured
any dark night by cutting down a sufficient number
of young trees in the demesne or plantation
of any gentleman in the neighbourhood—a prescriptive
<i>privilege</i> or rather <i>practice</i>, time immemorial,
throughout all Ireland.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having procured the said wattles <i>one way or
other</i>, it is only necessary to stick them down in
the sod in two rows, turning round the tops like
a woodbine arbour in a lady’s flower-garden, tying
the two ends together with neat ropes of hay,
which any gentleman’s farm-yard can (during the
night time, as aforesaid) readily supply,—then
fastening long wattles in like manner lengthways
at top from one end to the other to keep all tight
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>together; and thus the “wooden walls” of Donnybrook
are ready for roofing in; and as the
building materials cost nothing but <i>danger</i>, the
<i>expense</i> is very trivial.</p>

<p class='c004'>A tent fifty feet long may be easily built in
about five minutes, unless the builders should
adopt the old mode of <i>peeling</i> the wattles; and
when once a wattle is stripped to its <i>buff</i>, he must
be a wise landlord indeed who could swear to the
identity of the timber—a species of evidence nevertheless
that the Irish wood-rangers are extremely
expert at.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a> This precaution will not however be
necessary for the Don Cossacks, who being educated
as highway robbers by the Emperor of all
the Russias, and acting in that capacity in every
country, cannot of course be called to account for
a due exercise of their vocation.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r28'>28</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I recollect a man at the assizes of Maryborough swearing
to the leg of his own goose, which was stolen—having found it in
some <i>giblet broth</i> at the robber’s cabin. The witness was obviously
right; the web between the goose’s toes being, he said,
<i>snipped and cut</i> in a way he could perfectly identify.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>The covering of the tents is now only requisite;
this is usually done according to fancy; and being
unacquainted with the taste of the Russian gentlemen
on that head, I shall only mention the
general mode of <i>clothing</i> the wattles used in my
time—a mode that, from its singularity, had a far
more imposing appearance than any encampment
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>ever pitched by his majesty’s regular forces, horse,
foot, or artillery. Every cabin, alehouse, and
other habitation wherein quilts or bedclothes were
used, or could be procured by <i>civility</i> or <i>otherwise</i>
(except <i>money</i>, which was not current for such purposes),
was ransacked for <i>apparel</i> wherewith to
cover the wattles. The favourite covering was
<i>quilts</i>, as long as such were forthcoming; and
when not, old winnowing sheets, sacks ripped
open, rugs, blankets, &amp;c. &amp;c.—Every thing, in
fact, was expended in the <i>bed</i> line (few neighbours
using that accommodation during the fair)—and
recourse often had to women’s apparel, as old
petticoats, praskeens, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c004'>The covering being spread over the wattles as
tightly and snugly as the materials would admit,
all was secured by hay ropes and pegs. When
completed, a very tall wattle with a dirty birch-broom,
the hairy end of an old sweeping brush, a
cast-off lantern of some watchman, rags of all
colours made into streamers, and fixed at the top
by way of sign, formed the invitation to <i>drinking</i>;—and
when <i>eating</i> was likewise to be had, a rusty
tin saucepan, or piece of a broken iron pot, was
hung dangling in front, to crown the entrance and
announce good cheer.</p>

<p class='c004'>The most amusing part of the coverings were
the quilts, which were generally of patchwork,
comprising scraps of all the hues in the rainbow—cut
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>into every shape and size, patched on each
other, and quilted together.</p>

<p class='c004'>As to furniture, down the centre doors, old or
new, (whichever were most handy to be <i>lifted</i>,)
were stretched from one end to the other, resting
on hillocks of clay dug from underneath, and so
forming a capital table with an agreeable variety
both as to breadth and elevation. Similar constructions
for benches were placed along the sides,
but not so steady as the table; so that when the
liquor got the mastery of one convivial fellow, he
would fall off, and the whole row generally following
his example, perhaps ten or even twenty gallant
<i>shamrocks</i> were seen on their backs, kicking
up their heels, some able to get up again, some
lying quiet and easy, singing, roaring, laughing, or
cursing; while others, still on their legs, were
drinking and dancing, and setting the whole tent
in motion, till all began to long for the open air,
and a little wrestling, leaping, cudgelling, or fighting
upon the green grass. The tent was then
cleaned out and prepared for a new company of
the shillelah boys.</p>

<p class='c004'>The best tents, that supplied “neat victuals,”
had a pot boiling outside on a turf fire, with good
fat lumps of salt beef and cabbage, called “spooleens,”
always ready simmering for such customers
as should like a <i>sliver</i>. The potatoes were plentiful,
and salt Dublin-bay herrings also in abundance.
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>There was, besides, a cold round or rump of beef
at double price for the <i>quality</i> who came to see
the <i>curiosities</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Except toys and trinkets for children, merchandise
of any sort they seemed to have a contempt
for; but these were bought up with great avidity;
and in the evening, when the parents had given
the <i>childer</i> a glass each of the <i>cratur</i> (as they called
whisky), “to keep the cowld out of their little
stomachs,” every trumpet or drum, fiddle, whistle,
or pop-gun, which the fond mothers had bestowed,
was set sounding (all together) over the green,
and chimed in with a dozen fiddlers and as many
pipers jigging away for the dance,—an amalgamation
of sounds among the most extraordinary
that ever <i>tickled</i> the ear of a musician. Every
body, drunk or sober, took a share in the <i>long</i>
dance, and I have seen a row of a hundred couple
labouring at their jig steps till they fell off actually
breathless, and rather <i>wetter</i> than if they
had been river deities of the Donnybrook.</p>

<p class='c004'>This however must be remarked as constituting
a grand distinction between the beloved St. Bartholomew
of the cockneys and the Emeralders’
glory;—that at the former, robbers, cheats, gamblers,
and villains of every description collect,
and are most active in their respective occupations;
whilst at the latter, no gambling of any
sort existed;—nor were thieves, pickpockets or
swindlers often there: for a good reason—because
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>there was no money worth stealing, and <i>plenty</i> of
<i>emptiness</i> in the pockets of the amateurs. However,
love reigned in all its glory, and Cupid
expended every arrow his mother could make for
him: but with this difference, that love is in
general represented as discharging his shafts into
people’s hearts, whereas, at Donnybrook, he always
aimed at their <i>heads</i>; and before it became
quite dusk he never failed to be very successful
in his archery. It was after sunset, indeed, that
sweethearts made up their matches; and a priest
(Father Kearny of Liffy Street, a good <i>clergy</i>) told
me that more marriages were celebrated in Dublin
the week <i>after</i> Donnybrook fair, than in any two
months during the rest of the year: the month of
June being warm and <i>snug</i> (as he termed it),
smiled on every thing that was good, and helped
the <i>liquor</i> in making arrangements; and with
great animation he added, that it was a gratifying
sight to see his young parishioners who had made
up their matches at Donnybrook coming there in
a couple of years again, to buy whistles for their
children.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <i>horse</i> part of the fair was not destitute of
amusement—as there was a large ditch with a
drain, and a piece of a wall, which the sellers
were always called upon to “leather their horses
over” before any body would bid for them; and
the tumbles which those venturous jockies constantly
received, with the indifference wherewith
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>they mounted and began again, were truly entertaining.</p>

<p class='c004'>The common Irish are the most heroic horsemen
I ever saw:—it was always one of their attributes.
They ride on the horse’s bare back with
rapidity and resolution; and coming from fairs, I
have often seen a couple or sometimes three fellows
riding one bare-backed horse as hard as he could
go, and safely—not one of whom, if they were on
their own legs, could stand perpendicular half a
minute.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is a mistake to suppose that Donnybrook was
a remarkable place for <i>fighting</i>, or that much <i>blood</i>
was ever drawn there. On the contrary, it was
a place of good-humour. Men, to be sure, were
knocked down now and then, but there was no
malice in it. A head was often cut, but quickly
tied up again. The women first parted the combatants
and then became mediators; and every
fray which commenced with a knock-down, generally
ended by shaking hands, and the parties
getting dead drunk together.</p>

<p class='c004'>That brutal species of combat, <i>boxing</i>, was
never practised at our fairs; and that savage nest
and hot-bed of ruffians called the “Ring,” so
shamefully tolerated in England, was unknown
among the Emeralders.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a> With the shillelah, indeed,
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>they had great skill; but it was only like
sword exercise, and did not appear savage. Nobody
was disfigured thereby, or rendered fit for a
doctor. I never saw a bone broken or any dangerous
contusion from what they called “<i>whacks</i>”
of the shillelah (which was never too heavy): it
was like fencing: a cut on the skull they thought
no more of than we should of the prick of a needle:
of course, such accidents frequently occurred, and
(I believe very well for them) let out a little of
their blood, but did not for a single moment interrupt
the song, the dance, the frolicking and good-humour.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r29'>29</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I remember one man of tremendous strength from Carlow
County (Corcoran by name): he fancied he could knock down
any man or beast on earth with his fist, and by downright muscular
vigour, bear down the guards of all science or resistance.
He went over to England to fight any “man, woman, or
child,” in the whole nation; and when I was at temple, made
sad examples of some of the scientific fancy. He could knock
down the ablest horse with one blow of his fist. I never saw
near so strong a person.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>I have said, that the danger I underwent at
Donnybrook sank deep into my memory. The
main cause of it was not connected with my rencounter
with Counsellor Daly, recited in the second
volume of the present work, but with one
which was to the full as hazardous, though it involved
none of those points of honour or “fire-eating”
which forced me to the other conflict.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the year 1790, Counsellor John Byrne, (afterward
one of his majesty’s counsel-at-law,) a very
worthy man, and intimate friend of mine, called
on me to ride with him and aid him in the purchase
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>of a horse at the fair of Donnybrook. I
agreed, and away we rode, little anticipating the
sad discomfiture we should experience. We found
the fair rich in all its glories of drinking, fighting,
kissing, making friends, knocking down, women
dragging their husbands out of frays, and wounded
men joining as merrily in the dance as if the clout
tied round their heads were a Turkish turban.
Whatever happened <i>in</i> the fair, neither revenge
nor animosity went <i>out</i> of it with any of the
parties; to be sure, on the road to town, there
were always seen plenty of pulling, hauling, and
dragging about, in which the ladies were to the
full as busily employed as the gentlemen; but for
which the latter offered, next day, one general
excuse to their wives, who would be mending
their torn coats and washing their stockings and
cravats.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure, Moll, it wasn’t <i>myself</i> that was <i>in it</i>
when I knocked Tom Sweeny down in the tent;
it was the <i>drink</i>, and nothing else.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“True for you, Pat, my jewel!” would the wife
cry, (scrubbing away as hard as she could,) “true
for you, my darling: by my sowl, the whisky and
<i>water</i> was all <i>spirits</i>. Myself would as soon strike
my owld mother, God forgive me for the word!
as have struck Mary Casey, only for that last
noggin that put the devil into me just when I
was aggravated at your <i>head</i>, Pat, my jewel. So
I hit Mary Casey a wipe; and by my sowl it’s I
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>that am sorry for that same, becaize Mary had
neither act nor part in cutting your head, Pat;
but I was aggravated, and did not think of the
<i>differ</i>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This dialogue, with variations, I have heard a
hundred times; and it will serve as a true specimen
of the species of quarrels at Donnybrook in
former times, and their general conclusion;—and
such were the scenes that the visitors of the fair
were making full preparation for, when Counsellor
John Byrne, myself, and a servant lad of
mine (not a very good horseman), entered it in
the year 1790. The boy was mounted on a fiery
horse, which Byrne wanted to exchange; and as
I never liked <i>any thing</i> that was too tame, the
horse I rode always had spirit enough, particularly
for a gentleman who was not very remarkable
for <i>sticking over-fast</i> to those animals.</p>

<p class='c004'>Into the fair we went, and riding up and down,
got here a curse, and there a blessing; sometimes
a fellow who knew one of us, starting out of a tent
to offer us a glass of the “cratur.” When we
had satisfied our reasonable curiosity, and laughed
plentifully at the grotesque scenes interspersed
through every part, we went to the horse-fair on
the green outside. There the jockies were in
abundance; and certainly no fair ever exhibited a
stranger <i>mélange</i> of the halt and blind, the sound
and rotten, rough and smooth—all galloping,
leaping, kicking, or tumbling—some in clusters,
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>some singly; now and then a lash of the long
whip, and now and then a crack of the loaded
butt of it! At length, a horse was produced (which
we conceived fit for any counsellor) by Mr. Irvin
the jockey, and engaged, upon his <i>honour</i>, to be
as sound as a <i>roach</i>, and as steady as any beast
between Donnybrook and <i>Loughrea</i>, where he had
been the favourite gelding of Father Lynch, the
parish priest, who called him “Coadjutor”—(he
had broken the holy father’s neck, by the bye,
about a year before). “Do just try him, Counsellor
Byrne,” said Mr. Irvin; “just mount him
a bit, and if ever you get off him again till you
grease my fist, I’ll forgive you the luck-penny.
He’ll want neither whip nor spur; he’ll know
your humour, counsellor, before you’re five minutes
on his body, and act accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re sure he’s <i>gentle</i>?” said Byrne.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gentle, is it? I’ll give you leave to skin both
himself and me if you won’t soon like him as well
as if he was (begging your pardon) your own
cousin-german. If he wasn’t the thing from
muzzle to tail that would suit you, I’d hang him
before I’d give him to a counsellor—the like of
yees at any rate.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A provisional bargain and exchange was soon
struck, and Byrne mounted for trial on the
favourite gelding of the late Father Lynch of
Loughrea, called Coadjutor;—and in truth he
appeared fully to answer all Mr. Irvin’s eulogiums:
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>we rode through the fair, much amused—I trotting
carelessly close by the side of Byrne, and our servant
on the fiery mare behind us; when, on a
sudden, a drunken shoemaker, or <i>master cobbler</i>,
as he called himself, whom my family had employed
in heeling, soling, &amp;c. seeing me pass by,
rushed out of his tent with a bottle of whisky in
one hand and a glass in the other, and roared,
“Ough! by J—s, Barnton, you go no further till
you take a drop with me, like your father’s son,
that I’ve been these many a long year tapping and
foxing for: here, my darling, open your gob!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Byrne being nearest, the cobbler stepped under
the neck of my friend’s horse, and his sconce
getting entangled in the loose reins, the horse (not
understanding that species of interruption) began
to caper—which at the same time rather shaking
Counsellor Byrne in his seat, and further entangling
the shoemaker’s head, I leant across
to get Byrne’s rein fair; but being unable to do
so, from the fury of the son of Crispin, who was
hitting Bucephalus on the skull as hard as he could
with the bottle, to make him <i>stand easy</i> and to
get his own head clear, my leg got entangled in
the reins; and Byrne’s <i>gentle</i> gelding making one
or two simultaneous leaps forward and kicks behind,
I had the horror of seeing my poor friend fly
far over his horse’s head, alight rather heavily
upon his own, and having done so, lie quite flat
and still, seeming to take no further notice either
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>of the fair, the horses, myself, or any earthly
matter whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c004'>My steed now began to follow so bright a precedent;—the
cobbler, meanwhile, still cracking
away with his bottle at both beasts. My seat of
course became less firm; and at length I yielded
to imperative circumstances, and being detached
from my saddle (and also, fortunately, from the
stirrups), I came easily down—but not clear of
either horse; for I reluctantly fell just between
the two, one of my legs being fast in Byrne’s
bridle and the other in my own. Both animals
were prepared to set off with the utmost expedition;
but I believe without the least idea as to
whither they were going. The cobbler fought hard
to get his head loose; but in vain; so with me he
must come, go wherever I might. The two geldings
now wheeled us off, plunging, kicking, and giving
me to understand (so far as I could understand
any thing) that I had little further to do than
commend my soul to Heaven, which, to tell truth,
I had neither leisure nor presence of mind to attempt.
It was lucky that the horses’ heads were
pulled together by the bridles; by holding which,
I defeated the attempt of “Coadjutor” to kick
me to pieces—a compliment that, with might and
main, he strove to pay me; and while dragged on
my back through a short space of the fair of Donnybrook
in company with the shoemaker (who
was obliged to run obliquely or be strangled
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>by the bridles), I had the additional pleasure of
feeling the wind of “Coadjutor’s” heels every
second dashing about my head, and also of looking
up at the bellies of both steeds; for I could
see nothing else, except the cobbler, who roared
in a voice that brought every man, woman and
child out of the tents. Some men, at the risk of
their own lives, closed on “the mad horses,” and
with their knives cut the bridles of both, and then
away went the two geldings, quite disencumbered,
as hard as their legs could carry them,—upsetting
tables, forms, pots of hot water, and in fact every
thing that came in their way—till they reached the
spot where Mr. Irvin stood, and sundry members
of their own species were disporting under their
master. When they were caught, and the <i>death</i>
of the two counsellors announced by the Dublin
horse-jockies, who were jealous of Mr. Irvin,
news was instantly sent to town that Galway
Irvin, a horse-jockey, had sold a vicious animal
to Counsellor Byrne, which had killed both him
and Counsellor Barrington on the green of Donnybrook.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mare my servant rode, though she did not
know what all this row was about, thought proper
to emulate so good an example. But being fonder
of <i>galloping</i> than <i>rearing</i>, she fairly ran away; and
the lad being unable to hold her in, they upset
every thing in their course, till having come in
contact with the cord of a tent, and being entangled
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>therein, down went horse and rider plump
against the wattles, which (together with the
quilts) yielding to their pressure, Byrne’s mare
and my groom instantly made an unexpected portion
of the company inside.</p>

<p class='c004'>My readers must picture to themselves a runaway
horse and his rider tumbling head foremost
into a tent among from ten to twenty Irishmen,
who had got <i>the drink in them</i>. Many were the
bruises and slight scarifications of the company
before they could get clear of what they thought
nothing but the devil or a whirlwind could possibly
have sent thus, without the least notice, to
destroy them. In fact Byrne had, a few months
after, a considerable sum to advance to satisfy all
parties for broken ware, &amp;c.: but the poor fellows
would charge nothing for broken heads or damaged
carcases.</p>

<p class='c004'>The shoemaker, who had certainly stood a narrow
risk of being choked, was the first to tell every
body his sad adventure; and to the end of my
days, I never shall forget the figure he cut. His
waistcoat was quite torn off his back while on the
ground; he lost both shoes; and the lower part
of his shirt acting as <i>locum tenens</i> for the back of
his small-clothes, which had likewise been rent
aside, nothing (with the conjunction of his horrified
countenance) ever presented a more ludicrous appearance.
He continued to roar “Murder! murder!”
much in the yelping tone of a poor dog run
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>over by a carriage, or of a little cur, when, having
got a shrewd bite from a big one, he is galloping
off with his tail between his legs, to claim the
protection of his mistress. On being disengaged,
the son of Crispin limped off to the next tent,
where (every body flocking round him) he held up
the bottle, of which he loudly swore he had never
quitted his gripe,—“Not,” he said, “for the lucre
of a glass bottle—the bottle be d—’d! but for the
sake of the <i>cratur</i> that was in it, though that was
all spilt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>As for myself, I really know not how I escaped
so well: my hat stuck fast, which saved my
head; I held as tightly as I could by both reins;
and in the short distance we were dragged, received
very few hard bumps upon the ground,
which, fortunately for all parties, was grassy, and
had neither stones nor gravel. My coat was torn,
my hands a little cut by the reins, and my ankle
by the stirrup, as my foot got disentangled therefrom;—but
I received no injury of any consequence.</p>

<p class='c004'>The most melancholy part of the story relates to
my friend Byrne, who (though by far the simplest
process) was the only material sufferer. So soon
as I could set myself to rights in the next tent,
and had taken a large tumbler of hot punch—as
they said, to <i>drive the fright</i> out of me—I hastened
to my companion, who, when last I saw him, lay
motionless on the ground. I was told he had
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>been brought into a tent, and there laid out upon
a table as if dead; and had he not exhibited
signs of life pretty soon, the folks would have proceeded
to <i>wake</i> and <i>stretch</i> him, and when he was
<i>decent</i>, to cover him with a quilt, and carry him
home <i>next morning</i> on a door to his family.</p>

<p class='c004'>On my arrival, I found him greatly confused,
and quite helpless: there was, however, no bone
broken, or any wound or bruise that I could see.
He merely complained of a pain in his neck and
shoulders, and I considered that the general shock
he had received was his only injury. While he lay
nearly insensible, but had shown signs of life, the
women forced burnt whisky down his throat out
of a bottle, which certainly revived him. He was
then bled by a farrier, and we got him home in a
carriage, though in considerable pain. The surgeon
employed (I don’t name him) said nothing was
injured; but in less than a week, to the horrible
torture of poor Byrne, and the discomfiture of the
<i>doctor</i>, it turned out that his right shoulder had
been dislocated, and the use of his arm entirely
destroyed. After the lapse of such an interval, of
course extreme inflammation took place, and for
many months he could scarcely move.</p>

<p class='c004'>I fancy <i>horse jockeying</i> and the <i>fair of Donnybrook</i>
never subsequently escaped Byrne’s memory.
In fact, the circumstance proved nearly
fatal to him several years after. His shoulder
having remained so long unset, the muscles became
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>rigid, and he never had the power of raising
his right arm upon a level again. This deprivation,
as mentioned in Vol. ii., he felt acutely on
his duel with the Earl of Kilkenny, who hit
him before he could bring up his arm to any
position.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have thus given a true sketch of Donnybrook
fair forty years ago. I, however, remember it
twenty years earlier—as I used to be taken thither
when a child by the maid-servants, under pretence
of diverting “little master;” and they and their
sweethearts always crammed me with cakes to a
surfeit, that I might not tell my grandmother what
I saw of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <i>country</i> fairs of Ireland, though of the same
genus, were of a different species; and there were
great varieties among that species—according to
the habits, customs, and manners of the several
provinces, counties, or parishes, wherein they
were held. The southern, eastern, and western
fairs had considerable similitude to each other;
but the northern, if I may apply exaggerated epithets,
could boast more <i>rogues</i>, while at the former
the preponderance was of <i>madmen</i>. The <i>southerns</i>
certainly loved fighting vastly better, and after
they had done were vastly less vindictive than
the northern descendants of the Caledonians.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r30'>30</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I do not think that the southern and western Irish have, or
ever will have, any ardent brotherly affection for their northern
fellow-countrymen (exclusive of differences in religion). The
former descended direct from the aboriginals of the land; the
latter are deduced from Scotch colonists, and those not of the
very best occupations or character either.</p>

<p class='c004'>An anecdote told of Sir Hercules Langreish and Mr. Dundas
is illustrative of this observation, and was one of our standing
jokes, when Ireland existed as a nation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Dundas, himself a keen sarcastic man, who loved his
bottle nearly as well as Sir Hercules, invited the baronet to a
grand dinner in London, where the wine circulated freely, and
wit kept pace with it. Mr. Dundas, wishing to procure a
laugh at Sir Hercules, said:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, Sir Hercules, is it true that we Scotch formerly
<i>transported</i> all our criminals and felons to Ireland?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I dare say,” replied Sir Hercules; “but did you ever hear,
Mr. Dundas, of any of your countrymen <i>returning</i> to <i>Scotland</i>
from transportation?”</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>At country fairs, the feasting and drinking
were still more boisterous—what they call <i>obstropulous</i>
in Ireland; but being generally held in
towns, there was less character exhibited, and
consequently less food for observation to spectators.
The fighting, too, was of a different nature,
and far more serious than at Donnybrook. I will
cite a fair that I seldom missed attending for
several years, solely in order to see the fight which
was sure to conclude it. It was called the fair
of Dysart, held in a beautiful country in the valley
below the green Timahoe hills, and close to one of
the most interesting and beautiful of Irish ruins,
the rock of Donnamase, where, in ancient times,
sword-duels were fought, as I have heretofore
mentioned. Cromwell battered it, and slaughtered
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>the warders of the O’Moores, who held their
hereditary fortress while they had an arm to defend
it.</p>

<p class='c004'>To this fair resorted sundry factions—as they
were termed; a <i>faction</i> consisting of one of two
parishes, baronies, or town-lands, that were very
good friends in small parties or individually, but
had a prescriptive deadly hatred to each other at
all great meetings, fairs, returns from alehouses,
&amp;c. At races or hurlings, where gentlemen presided,
no symptoms of animosity were apparent.</p>

<p class='c004'>But a tacit compact was always understood
to exist that the <i>factions</i> should fight at the fair
of Dysart once a year; and accordingly, none of
them ever failed to attend the field of battle with
their wives, and generally a reasonable number of
infant children, whose cries and shrieks during
their <i>daddies’</i> conflict formed a substitute for
martial music—mingled, indeed, with the incessant
rattle of the ladies’ tongues, as they fought
and struggled, like the Sabine women, to separate
combatants, who would come on purpose to
fight again.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fair went on quietly enough at first as to
buying, selling, and <i>trucking</i> of cows, pigs, frieze
and other merchandise: but when trade grew
slack, the whisky got in vigour, and the time
came when the same little “whacking, plase
your honour, that our fathers before us always
did at Dysart,” could no longer be deferred.
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>There being however no personal or ostensible
cause of dispute, one or two <i>boys</i> were always
sent out to <i>pick</i> a quarrel and give just reason for
the respective <i>factions</i> to come to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c004'>Their weapon was almost exclusively an oaken
cudgel:—neither iron, steel, nor indeed any deadlier
substance, so far as I ever saw, was in use
among them; and “boxing matches,” as before
observed, were considered altogether too gross
and vulgar for the direct descendants of Irish
<i>princes</i>, as in fact many of them were. The friends
and neighbours of the pugnacious factions, always
in bodies, joined more or less warmly in the fray.
In truth, it would be totally impossible to keep
an Irish peasant, man or woman (if <i>the drop</i> was
in), from joining in any battle going merrily on.
Before the fray had ended, therefore, the entire
assemblage was engaged in some degree; and it
was commonly a drawn battle, seldom concluding
till all parties and each sex, fairly out of breath,
were unable to fight any more. Two hours or
thereabouts was considered as a decent period for
a beating match, and some priest generally put an
end to it when the <i>factions</i> were themselves tired.</p>

<p class='c004'>These battles commenced in the most extraordinary
manner; the different modes of picking
a quarrel being truly comical. One fellow generally
took off his long frieze coat, and flourishing
his shillelah, which he trailed along the ground,
vociferated, “Horns! horns! ram’s horns! who
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>dares say any thing’s crookeder than ram’s
horns?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By J—s, I know <i>fat</i> will be twice crookeder
nor any ram’s horns before the fair’s over,” another
sturdy fellow would reply, leaping, as he
spoke, out of a tent, armed with his “walloper”
(as they called their cudgel), and spitting in his
fist—“By J—s, I’ll make your own skull crookeder
nor any ram’s horn in the barony.” The
<i>blow</i> of course followed the <i>word</i>;—the querist
was laid sprawling on the ground;—out rushed
the <i>factious</i> from every tent, and to work they fell—knocking
down right and left, tumbling head
over heels, then breaking into small parties, and
fighting through and round the tents. If one
fellow lost his “walloper,” and was pressed by
numbers, he sometimes tugged at a wattle till he
detached it from a tent, and sweeping it all around
him, prostrated men, women, and children:—one,
tumbling, tripped up another; and I have seen them
lying in hillocks, yet scarcely any body in the least
injured. Sometimes one faction had clearly the
best of it; then they ran away in their turn, for
there was no determined stand made by any party—so
that their alternate advancing, retreating,
running away, and rallying, were productive of
huge diversion. Whoever got his head cut (and
that was generally the case with more than half
of them), ran into some tent, where the women tied
up the hurt, gave the <i>sufferer</i> a glass of whisky,
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>and kept him fair and easy till news arrived that
the priest was come—when the combatants soon
grew more quiet. The priest then told them how
sinful they were. They thanked his reverence,
and said “they’d stop, <i>becaize</i> he desired them; but
it wasn’t <i>becaize</i> they wouldn’t like to make <i>sartain</i>
who’d have the best of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The hair being detached from about the cuts on
the head, the cuts themselves dressed, rags applied
to battered shins, &amp;c., the whisky went round
merrily again, and the several <i>factions</i> seldom departed
till they were totally <i>unable</i> to fight any
more. Some were escorted home by the priests
upon garrons (their wives behind them); some on
straw in cars; and some, too drunk to be moved,
remained in the neighbourhood. No animosity
was cherished; and until next fair they would do
each other any kind office. I witnessed many of
these <i>actions</i>, and never heard that any man was
“dangerously wounded.” But if they fought on
the road home, in very small parties, serious mischief
was not unfrequently the consequence.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <i>quere</i> as to ram’s horns was only one of
many curious schemes whereby to get up a quarrel.
I have seen a fellow going about the fair
dragging his coat, which was always considered
a challenge, like throwing down a glove or gauntlet
in olden times—and in fact was a relict of that
practice. Another favourite mode was, exclaiming
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>“black’s the white of my eye!—who dares say
<i>black</i> is <i>not</i> the <i>white</i> of my eye?”</p>

<p class='c004'>These scenes certainly took place at a time
when Ireland was reputed, and with truth, to be
in a very rough state. It has since undergone
plenty of civilization. Sunday schools, improved
magistracy, and a regular police, have recently
been introduced; and the present state of Ireland
proves the great advances it has made in consequence.
Of late years, therefore, though the
factions still fight, as usual, it is with more civilised
weapons. Instead of shillelahs and “wallopers,”
swords, pistols, and guns are the genteel
implements resorted to: and (to match the agriculturists)
scythes, hatchets, bill-hooks, and pitchforks
are used in their little encounters: and
surely the increased refinement of the country is
not to be relinquished on account of the loss of a
few lives.</p>

<p class='c004'>I fear some of my readers may call the latter
observations <i>ironical</i>; but the best way for them
to avoid that supposition is, to reflect what <i>savage</i>
Ireland was at the time I allude to, and what
<i>civilised</i> Ireland is at the moment I am writing;—in
the year 1780, when the peasantry fighting at
the fair of Dysart was in a savage state, the government
were so stingy of their army that they
would only spare the Irish five or six thousand
soldiers, and no militia, to teach them to behave
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>themselves: but after an interval of forty years,
they are now so kind as to allow us five-and-thirty
thousand troops to teach the new rudiments of
civilization—the old six thousand having had nothing
to do amongst these semi-barbarous islanders.
Nay, the government finding that Ballinrobe
(where, as I have stated, a sow and her ten
<i>piggin riggins</i> came to breakfast with two counsellors)
was making slow progress to this desirable
state of refinement, was so considerate as to send
certainly the best-bred regiment in the king’s service
to give lessons of urbanity to the people for
three hundred and sixty-five days without intermission.</p>

<p class='c004'>This boon to so backward a population as
County Mayo presented, must ever be remembered
with gratitude by the <i>undressed</i> gentlemen
of that county, though I have not seen any authentic
<i>exposé</i> of those beneficial effects which no
doubt resulted.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>THE WALKING GALLOWS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Brief reflections on the Irish Revolution of 1798—Mutual atrocities of the Royalists and Rebels—Irish humour buoyant to the last—O’Connor, the schoolmaster of County Kildare—“’Tis well it’s <i>no worse</i>”—The Barristers’ corps—Its commander—Lieutenant H——&nbsp;—His zeal for loyalty, and its probable origin—Indemnities unjustly obtained for cruelty against the insurgents—Lieutenant H——’s mode of executing a rebel—His <i>sobriquet</i>, and its well-earned application.</p>

<p class='c006'>Never was there an era in the history of any
country which, in so short a space of time, gave birth
to such numerous and varied circumstances as did
the memorable year 1798 in Ireland: nor was
there ever yet an event so important as the Irish
insurrection, but has afforded a veracious—or, at
least, a tolerably impartial narrative. But the party
rancour and virulent hatred of the religious sects
in the south, the centre and west of Ireland (where
the rebellion principally raged), operated to prevent
any fair record of those scenes of bloodshed
and atrocity which, on <i>both sides</i>, outraged every
principle of morality and justice, and every feeling
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>of consanguinity, honour, or humanity. The very
worst qualities were fostered to full maturity, and
the better ones turned adrift like discarded servants.
Blood, fire, and famine were the only
umpires resorted to by the contending parties.</p>

<p class='c004'>Those barbarities were nearly, if not altogether,
unexampled either in ancient or modern Europe:
but it is now thirty years since their termination;
the surviving contemporaries are old enough to
have their blood cooled and their prejudices moderated;—and
they should have grown sufficiently
dispassionate to speak of those scenes (if at all)
with honesty and candour.</p>

<p class='c004'>I was myself in the midst of the tumult: a zealous
loyalist; an officer in the corps of barristers;
an active partizan; in a word, a <i>strong</i> adherent of
government—but not a <i>blind</i> one. I could not shut
my eyes; I could not close my ears; I would
not pervert my reason; and the full use of those
faculties at that time, enables me now to state as
an historic fact—which some will deny, and many
may discredit—that the barbarities of that period
(though not precisely) were pretty nearly balanced
between the conflicting parties.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a> Mercy was alike
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>banished by both; and the instruments employed
of death and torture, though dissimilar, were alike
destructive: the bullet, sabre, bayonet, lash, and
halter, being met by the pike, the scythe, the
blunderbuss, the hatchet, and the firebrand.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r31'>31</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Never did there appear a more extravagant and therefore
mischievous historian than Sir Richard Musgrave proved himself
in his “History of Irish Rebellions, and principally that
of Ninety-eight,”—almost every chapter whereof is distinguished
by misconception and fanaticism. Lord Cornwallis disclaimed
the baronet’s dedication—who, on sinking into the grave,
left a legacy to his country—having fomented prejudices
against her in Great Britain which another century may not
extinguish.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Yet while human blood was pouring out in
streams, and human beings consuming in fire, or
writhing either upon rebel pikes or royal bayonets—will
it be believed?—men had grown so familiarised
to scenes of horror, that the eccentric humour
of the Irish people was insusceptible of decrease.
In the midst of tortures, either suffered
or inflicted, it frequently broke out into the most
ludicrous actions and expressions, proving to me
that an Irishman’s humour is so drilled into his
nature, as to be inexhaustible even to the moment
of his death (if that is not unusually too deliberate).<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r32'>32</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>O’Connor, a fat, comely, cheerful-looking schoolmaster of
County Kildare, was the first rebel executed for high treason.
His trial gave rise to one of the most curious dialogues (between
him and Judge Finucane) that ever took place in a court of
justice. It ended, however, by the judge (who was a humane
man) passing the usual sentence on him—“That he should be
hanged by the neck, but not till he was dead: that while still
alive his bowels should be taken out, his body quartered,” &amp;c.
&amp;c. The culprit bore all this with firm though mild complacency;
and on conclusion of the sentence bowed low, blessed
the judge for his <i>impartiality</i>, and turning about, said, “God’s
will be done! ’tis well <i>it’s no worse</i>!” I was surprised. I pitied
the poor fellow, who had committed no atrocity, and asked
him what he meant. “Why, Counsellor,” said he, “I was
afraid his lordship would order me to be <i>flogged</i>!” Every
rebel preferred death to the cat-o’-nine-tails! O’Connor’s head
remained some years on the top of Naas gaol.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>It is not in the nature, or within the comprehension,
of the sober English people to form any
judgment of what a true-born Irishman is capable
of saying or doing in his deepest extremities: and
I am sure they will give me little credit for veracity
when I mention some instances which, I own,
in any other country might be reasonably considered
incredible. In no other place existing
could the cruel and ludicrous be so mingled, as
they were in the transactions of the sanguinary
period in question; nor do I think there can be a
better way to inform and amuse the reader, than
by giving alternate anecdotes of the <i>royalists</i> and
the <i>rebels</i>, leaving it to his own judgment to draw
conclusions.—This one observation, however, it is
necessary, in justice, to premise;—that the royalists
were, generally speaking, of a higher class
than the rebels—and had received the advantages
of education, while the rebels were in a state of
total ignorance and beggary. The wanton barbarities,
therefore, of the more enlightened classes
have less ground of palliation than those of a
demi-savage peasantry, urged by fanaticism, and
blinded by ignorance. This observation was
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>strongly impressed on my mind throughout the
whole of that contest; and it would be acting
unfairly toward the officer who so judiciously
commanded the military corps I was then attached
to, not to say, that, though an unqualified
Protestant—an hereditary Huguenot, filled with
that spirit of sectionary zeal which drove his eloquent
ancestor from his native country; yet,
during the whole of the rebellion, Captain Saurin
never suffered the corps he led to indulge any
religious distinctions;—scarcely, indeed, could his
own sect be discovered by any particular of his
acts, orders, or conduct; nor did that corps ever
participate in, or even countenance, the violent
proceedings so liberally practised by other military
yeomen.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f33'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r33'>33</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I knew at least but of one exception to this remark respecting
the lawyers’ corps. Very early in the rebellion an
officer took down a detachment of that corps to Rathcool,
about seven miles from Dublin, without the knowledge of the
commandant. They were not aware of his object, which turned
out to be, to set fire to part of the town. He captured one
gentleman, Lieutenant Byrne, who was hanged;—and returned
to Dublin, in my mind <i>not</i> triumphant.</p>

<p class='c004'>He got several severe lectures, but none so strong as one
from the late Sir John Parnell, then chancellor of the exchequer,
whose heir, the present Sir Henry Parnell, was among
those unwittingly taken down.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>This line of conduct was most exemplary; and
from a thorough knowledge of the constitutional
attributes of the man, I am convinced that neither
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>his philanthropy, toleration, humility, or other
good qualities have been much increased by his
<i>schooling</i>, for the last twenty years, in the Irish
Four Courts.</p>

<p class='c004'>Among the extraordinary characters that turned
up in the fatal “ninety-eight,” there were few
more extraordinary than Lieutenant H——, then
denominated the “walking gallows;”—and such
he certainly was, literally and practically.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f34'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r34'>34</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This circumstance is mentioned in my “Historic Anecdotes
of the Union,” among several others, which were written before
the present work was in contemplation. But the incident now
before the reader is so remarkable that I have gone into it
more particularly. Many will peruse this book who will never
see the other, into which have been interwoven, in fact, <i>numerous</i>
sketches of those days that I now regret I did not retain
for the present work, to which they would have been quite
appropriate.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant H—— was an officer of the line,
on half pay. His brother was one of the solicitors
to the Crown—a quiet, tremulous, <i>vino deditus</i> sort
of man, and a leading Orangeman;—his widow, who
afterward married and survived a learned doctor,
was a clever, positive, good-looking Englishwoman,
and, I think, fixed the doctor’s avowed <i>creed</i>: as to
his genuine <i>faith</i>, that was of little consequence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant H—— was about six feet two
inches high;—strong, and broad in proportion.
His strength was great, but of the dead kind, unaccompanied
by activity. He could lift a ton, but
could not leap a rivulet; he looked mild, and his
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>address was civil—neither assuming nor at all ferocious.
I knew him well, and from his countenance
should never have suspected him of cruelty;
but so cold-blooded and so eccentric an executioner
of the human race I believe never yet existed,
save among the American Indians.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f35'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r35'>35</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His mode of execution being perfectly novel, and at the
same time <i>ingenious</i>, Curran said, “The lieutenant should
have got a patent for cheap strangulation.”</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>His inducement to the strange barbarity he
practised I can scarcely conceive; unless it proceeded
from that natural taint of cruelty which so
often distinguishes man above all other animals
when his power becomes uncontrolled. The propensity
was probably strengthened in him from
the indemnities of martial law, and by those
visions of promotion whereby violent partizans
are perpetually urged, and so frequently disappointed.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f36'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r36'>36</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“We love the treason, but hate the traitor,” is an aphorism
which those who assume prominent parts in any public
convulsion are sure to find verified. Many instances took
place in Ireland; and in France exemplifications occurred to a
very considerable extent. A blind <i>zealot</i> is of all men most
likely to become a <i>renegade</i> if he feel it more convenient: prejudice
and interest unite to form <i>furious</i> partizans, who are
never guided by <i>principle</i>—for principle is founded on judgment.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>At the period alluded to, law being suspended,
and the courts of justice closed, the “question”
by torture was revived and largely practised. The
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>commercial exchange of Dublin formed a place of
execution; even <i>suspected</i> rebels were every day
immolated as if <i>convicted</i> on the clearest evidence;
and Lieutenant H——’s <i>pastime</i> of hanging <i>on
his own back</i> persons whose physiognomies he
thought characteristic of rebellion was, (I am
ashamed to say) the subject of jocularity instead
of punishment. What in other times he would
himself have died for, as a murderer, was laughed
at as the manifestation of loyalty: never yet was
martial law so abused, or its enormities so hushed
up<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a> as in Ireland. Being a military officer, the
lieutenant conceived he had a right to do just
what he thought proper, and to make the most
of his time while martial law was flourishing.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f37'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r37'>37</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The open indemnification of Mr. Judkin Fitzgerald, of
Tipperary, for his cruelties in that county, was one of the worst
acts of a vicious government. The prime serjeant, Mr. St.
George Daly, though then the first law officer, (a <i>Union</i> one, too,
as subsequently appeared,) voted against that most flagitious act
of Parliament, which nothing but the raging madness of those
times could have carried through any assembly. The dread
of its recurrence did much to effect the Union.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Once, when high in blood, he happened to meet
a <i>suspicious-looking</i> peasant from County Kildare,
who could not satisfactorily account for
himself according to the lieutenant’s notion of
evidence; and having nobody at hand to vouch
for him, the lieutenant of course immediately took
for granted that he <i>must</i> be a rebel strolling about,
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>and imagining the death of his Most Gracious
Majesty.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a> He therefore, no other <i>court of justice</i>
being at hand, considered that he had a right to
try the man by his <i>own opinion</i>; accordingly, after
a brief interrogation, he condemned him to die,
and without further ceremony proceeded to put
his own sentence into immediate execution.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f38'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r38'>38</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The lieutenant’s brother being a Crown solicitor, had now
and then got the lieutenant to copy the high treason indictments:
and he, seeing there that <i>imagining</i> the death of a <i>king</i>
was punished capitally, very naturally conceived that <i>wishing</i>
it was twice as bad as <i>supposing</i> it: having therefore no
doubt that <i>all</i> rebels wished it, he consequently decided in the
tribunal of his own mind to hang every man who hypothetically
and traitorously wished his majesty’s dissolution, which
wish he also conceived was very easily ascertained by the
wisher’s countenance.</p>

<p class='c004'>A cabinet-maker at Charing Cross some years ago put on
his board “patent coffin-maker to his majesty:” it was considered
that though this was not an <i>ill-intentioned</i>, yet it was a
very improper mode of <i>imagining</i> the king’s death, and the
board was taken down accordingly. Lieutenant H——
would surely have hanged him in Ireland.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>However, to do the lieutenant justice, his <i>mode</i>
was not near so tedious or painful as that practised
by the grand signior, who sometimes causes
the ceremony to be divided into three acts, giving
the culprit a drink of spring water to <i>refresh</i> him
between the two first; nor was it so severe as the
burning old women formerly for witchcraft. In
fact, the “walking gallows” was both on a new
and simple plan; and after some kicking and
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>plunging during the operation, never failed to be
completely effectual. The lieutenant being, as
before mentioned, of lofty stature, with broad and
strong shoulders, saw no reason why they might
not answer his majesty’s service upon a pinch as
well as two posts and a cross-bar (the more legitimate
instrument upon such occasions): and he
also considered that, when a rope was not at hand,
there was no good reason why his own silk cravat
(being softer than an ordinary halter, and of
course less calculated to <i>hurt</i> a man) should not
be a more merciful choke-band than that employed
by any <i>Jack Ketch</i> in the three kingdoms.</p>

<p class='c004'>In pursuance of these benevolent intentions, the
lieutenant, as a preliminary step, first knocked
down the suspected rebel from County Kildare,
which the weight of mettle in his fist rendered no
difficult achievement. His garters then did duty
as handcuffs: and with the aid of a brawny aide-de-camp
(one such always attended him), he pinioned
his victim hand and foot, and then most
considerately advised him to pray for King George,
observing that any prayers for his <i>own</i> d—d <i>popish
soul</i> would be only time lost, as his fate in every
world (should there be even a thousand) was decided
to all eternity for having imagined the death
of so good a monarch.</p>

<p class='c004'>During this exhortation, the lieutenant twisted
up his long cravat so as to make a firm, handsome
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>rope, and then expertly sliding it over the rebel’s
neck, secured it there by a double knot, drew the
cravat over his own shoulders, and the aide-de-camp
holding up the rebel’s heels, till he felt
him <i>pretty easy</i>, the lieutenant with a powerful
chuck drew up the poor devil’s head as high as
his own (cheek by jowl), and began to trot about
with his burden like a jolting cart-horse,—the
rebel choking and gulping meanwhile, until he
had no further solicitude about sublunary affairs—when
the lieutenant, giving him a parting chuck,
just to make sure that his neck was broken, threw
down his load—the personal assets about which
the aide-de-camp made a <i>present</i> of to <i>himself</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now all this proceeding was very pains-taking
and ingenious: and yet the ungrateful government
(as Secretary Cook assured me) would have
been better pleased had the execution taken
place on timber and with hemp, according to old
formalities.</p>

<p class='c004'>To be serious:—this story is scarcely credible—yet
it is a notorious fact; and the lieutenant, a few
nights afterward, acquired the <i>sobriquet</i> which
forms a head to this sketch, and with which he
was invested by the upper gallery of Crow Street
Theatre—nor did he ever get rid of it to his dying-day.</p>

<p class='c004'>The above <i>trotting</i> execution (which was humorously
related to me by an eye-witness) took
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>place in the barrack-yard at Kerry House, Stephen’s
Green. The <i>hangee</i> was, I believe, (<i>as it
happened</i>) in reality a rebel.</p>

<p class='c004'>Providence, however, which is said to do “every
thing for the best,” (though some persons who are
half starving, and others who think themselves
very unfortunate, will not allow it so much credit,)
determined that Lieutenant H——’s loyalty
and merits should meet their full reward in another
sphere—where, being quite out of the reach
of all his enemies, he might enjoy his destiny
without envy or interruption. It therefore, very
soon after the rebellion had terminated, took the
lieutenant into its own especial keeping; and
despatched a raging fever to bring him off to the
other world, which commission the said fever duly
executed after twenty-one days’ combustion;—and
no doubt his ghost is treated according to its
deserts; but nobody having since returned from
those regions to inform us what has actually become
of the lieutenant, it is still a <i>dead</i> secret, and
I fancy very few persons in Ireland have any wish
for the opportunity of satisfying their curiosity.
People however give a shrewd guess, that it is
<i>possible</i> he may be employed somewhere else in
the very same way wherein he entertained himself
in Ireland; and that after being duly furnished
with a tail, horns, and cloven foot, no spirit could
do infernal business better than the lieutenant.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>We have, in the foregoing sketch, seen something
of the unwarrantable acts whereof loyal zeal
was capable. Let us now take a glance, in fairness
and impartiality, at the conduct of the insurgents,—which
varied exceedingly in different
instances. Sometimes, almost as the humour of
the moment guided them, they would treat such
as fell in their power with lenity and moderation:
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>at others, no degree of cruelty was spared toward
those unfortunate individuals.</p>

<p class='c004'>They had at their mercy, during the whole
period, a man of high rank, their avowed, zealous,
and active enemy, a Protestant and Orangeman.
Yet, while numerous persons of inferior classes
were piked and butchered, the Earl of Kingston
was unmolested, and left at liberty on their evacuation
of Wexford. It were to be wished that
General Lake had shown similar generosity to
Mr. Cornelius Grogan, whose hasty and unmerited
execution by martial law savoured of deliberate
murder as strongly as the death of most who were
slaughtered by the rebels.</p>

<p class='c004'>On many occasions during that dreadful struggle,
jests were so strangely mixed up with murder,
that it was not easy to guess which way a scene
would terminate—whether in tragedy or comedy;
so much depended on the sobriety or intoxication
of the insurgents.</p>

<p class='c004'>One or two anecdotes (out of hundreds worth
recording) will serve to show in some degree the
spirit of the times; and we will preface them by
observing, that the district (the barony of Forth,
in County Wexford,) most active in rebellion,
most zealous and most sanguinary, was the identical
point whereon Strongbow, the first British
soldier who set foot in Ireland, had, six hundred
and twenty seven years before, begun his colonization.
Most of the Wexford rebels, indeed, were
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>lineal descendants of the original Britons who
came over there from South Wales and Bristol,
and repeopled that district after their countrymen
had nearly exterminated the aboriginal natives.</p>

<p class='c004'>The rebels had obliged Major Maxwell, with
the king’s troops, far too precipitately to evacuate
Wexford; and that officer, by the rapidity of his
movements, gave neither time nor notice to the
loyalists to retreat with him. It was therefore
considered, that Archdeacon Elgy, a dignitary of
the Protestant church, was the most likely subject
for the rebels to begin their slaughter with;
and the general opinion ran that he would have
at least a dozen pikes through his body before
dinner-time on the day the insurgents entered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of this way of thinking was the divine himself:
nor did the numerous corresponding surmises prove
erroneous. Sentence of death was promptly passed
upon the archdeacon, who was held to aggravate
his offences by contumacy.</p>

<p class='c004'>A certain shrewd fellow, yclept a <i>captain</i> among
the rebels, however, saw things in a different
point of view; and, though without any particularly
kind feelings toward the archdeacon, he, by
use of a very luminous argument, changed the determination
of his comrades.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the good,” said he, “of <i>piking</i> the old
man? Sure, if he’ll give in, and worship the Virgin
in our chapel, won’t it be a better job? They say
he’s a very good Orange parson, and why shouldn’t
he make a good <i>green priest</i>, if he’ll take on with
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>Father Cahill? Devil the much harm ever he did
us!—so, if yees agree to that same, I’ll tell him,
fair and easy, to <i>take on</i> with the Virgin to-morrow
in the big chapel, or he’ll find himself more <i>holy</i>
than <i>godly</i> before the sun sets.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The concluding joke, however trite, put them
all in good humour; and the orator proceeded:
“Come a couple of dozen of ye, boys, with
wattles on your shoulders; give me the colours
and cross, and we’ll go to Parson Elgy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In fact they went to the archdeacon, and Mr.
Murphy, the spokesman, told him very quietly
and civilly that he came to “offer his reverence
life and liberty, and a good parish too, if he
would only <i>do the thing</i> cleverly in the way Father
Cahill would show him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The reverend doctor, not comprehending the
nature of the condition, and conceiving that they
probably only required him to stand neuter, replied,
in a quivering voice, “that he would never
forget the obligations: he was well content with
the cure he had, but not the less indebted to them
for their kind offer to give him a better.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ough!” said Captain Murphy, “your reverence
happens to be all in the wrong.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The archdeacon of course fell into his nervous
fit again, and stood quaking as if both Saint Vitus’
dance and the <i>tic douloureux</i> had assailed him at
once with their utmost rancour.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>“I am only come,” resumed Murphy, “just to
give your reverence two little <i>choices</i>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, Lord! Captain Murphy, what are they?”
cried the clerical gentleman.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Either to take your turn to-morrow in the big
<i>chapel</i>, with our clergy, and be one of them yourself,
or to receive two-and-twenty pikes straight
<i>through</i> your reverence’s carcase, as you will
otherwise do, before the sun sets this blessed day—and
by my sowl it’s not far from that time now!
(Here the doctor groaned most heavily.) One of
the things,” pursued the rebel, “is quite easy for
your reverence to do, and the other is quite easy
for <i>us</i> to do; and so there will be no great trouble
in it either way. Come on, lads, and just show
your <i>switches</i> to his reverence.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Above twenty long pikes were instantly flourished
in the air with an hurra that nearly shook every
nerve of the archdeacon out of its natural situation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah, gentlemen!” said he, “spare a poor old
man, who never harmed any of you. For the
love of God, spare me!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Arrah! be easy, parson,” said Captain Murphy:
“sure there’s but <i>one</i> God between us all,
and that’s plenty, if there were as many more of
us. So what are we differing and bothering
about? whether you say your prayers in the
<i>church</i> or in the <i>chapel</i>, in <i>Latin</i> or in <i>English</i>;
whether you reckon them on your beads, or read
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>them on your book,—sure it’s all one to Him, and
no great <i>differ</i>, I should think, to any sensible gentleman,—especially
when he cannot help himself!
Boys, handle your switches; though, by my sowl,
I’d be sorry to <i>skiver</i> your reverence.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The archdeacon, though an excellent orthodox
parson, now began to see his way, and was
too wise to have any thing to do with Captain
Murphy’s <i>switches</i> if it were avoidable. He recollected
that the great bishops and archbishops
who were roasted alive in Queen Mary’s time, for
the very same reason, got but little credit from
posterity for their martyrdom; and how could he
expect <i>any</i> for being <i>piked</i>, which was not half so
dilatory a death as roasting? Then, again, he considered
that twenty pikes in a man’s body would
not be near as nourishing as one barnacle or lobster
(on which he had for many years loved to
feed). He deemed it better to make a merit of
necessity; and accordingly, putting on a civil
face, agreed to all their proposals. He then took
a drink of holy water (which Captain Murphy
always carried in a bottle about with him); made
several crosses upon his forehead with a feather
dipped in some “blessed oil” (tinged with green);
and after every pike-man had shaken him by the
fist, and called him Father Pat Elgy, it was
finally settled he should next day be rechristened
in “the big chapel” by all the Fathers, taught
to celebrate mass as well as the best of them, and
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>get a <i>protection</i> for having <i>taken on</i> as a true Catholic.</p>

<p class='c004'>The gentlemen with their <i>switches</i> now retired,
uplifting shouts of exultation at having <i>converted</i>
the archdeacon, while that dignitary tottered
back to his family, who had given him up
for lost, were bewailing his cruel martyrdom, and
triumphed at his return, though at the expense of
his orthodoxy. A cold roast leg of mutton was then
produced;—and heartily discussing that <i>creature
comfort</i>, his reverence could not avoid congratulating
himself when he observed the mark of the
<i>spit</i>, and reflected that there would have been
two-and-twenty much wider perforations drilled
through his own body had not Captain Murphy
made a <i>papist</i> of him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Next morning, <i>Father Elgy</i> was duly christened
<i>Patrick</i>; renounced Martin Luther, in the great
chapel of Wexford, as an egregious impostor;
and being appointed a <i>coadjutor</i>, celebrated mass
with considerable dexterity and proper gesticulation.
He subsequently set about getting the
double manual by heart, that he might be ready
to <i>chaunt</i>, as soon as Father Cahill should teach
him the several tunes.</p>

<p class='c004'>The archdeacon, though he had no great reason
to be ashamed of his second christening, (particularly
as he had always prayed against <i>sudden
death</i> while he was a Protestant,) could yet never
bear, in after times, to hear the circumstance alluded
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>to, since it could not be mentioned but a
laugh was unavoidable. I often saw Murphy
afterward: he had been generally humane, saved
many lives, and was not prosecuted. He himself
told me the foregoing story, with that exquisite
simplicity which belongs almost exclusively to his
rank of Irishmen.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another Protestant clergyman did not fare quite
so well as the archdeacon, being never able to
look any man <i>straight</i> in the face afterward. Parson
Owen, brother to Miss Owen of Dublin (heretofore
mentioned in the anecdotes of Doctor Achmet
Borumborad), had a small living in the neighbourhood
of Wexford; and as he looked for
church preferment, was, of course, a violent, indeed
an outrageous royalist. Now, as almost
every man among his parishioners held a different
creed, both in religion and politics, he was not
over-popular in <i>quiet</i> days; and when the bustle
began, thinking it high time to secure his precious
person, he retired for better security into the town
of Wexford. He had not, however, consulted an
<i>oracle</i>;—that being the first place attacked by the
rebels: and Major Maxwell, as has been stated,
having with his garrison retreated without beat of
drum, the parson found himself necessitated to
resort to a cockloft in a grocer’s house in the Bull-ring
at Wexford; where, provisions not being
quite handy, and an empty stomach good for contemplation,
he had ample opportunity to reflect on
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>the species of death he would, most likely meet.
The <i>promotion</i> of <i>Father Pat Elgy</i> had not come to
his knowledge.</p>

<p class='c004'>Previous to this event, the parson had fallen in
love with the only daughter of Mr. Brown, a rich
trader, who had formerly kept a tan-yard in Enniscorthy;
or rather his reverence <i>fell in love</i> with
a great number of <i>government debentures</i>, bearing
interest at five per cent per annum, which the
young lady informed him would be all her own if
she “behaved herself.” He had, therefore, three
cogent reasons for seeking to prolong his life:—first,
the natural love of it; secondly, the debentures;
and <i>lastly</i>, the damsel.</p>

<p class='c004'>However, his security was by no means permanent.
Early one morning, wishing to get a
mouthful of fresh air, his reverence ventured to
peep out of his garret-window into the street, and
was instantly recognised by one of the <i>wattle-boys</i>,
as the pike-men were then called.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hah! hah! your reverence is there, sure
enough,” said the man of the wattle. “Ough! by
my sowl if you budge out of that peep-hole till I
come back again, we’ll make a big bonfire of ye
and your Orange family altogether. Plaze, now,
don’t let me <i>lose sight</i> of your reverence while I
run for my commander: it’s he’ll know what to
do with the likes of ye.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The rebel immediately ran off, but soon returned
with the same “Captain Murphy,” and a
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>whole company of pike-men, just to “skiver the
parson.” Owen was a dapper, saucy, pert-looking,
little fellow: he had good sharp eyes, an excellent
use of his tongue, and was considered
keen: and though a high churchman, he was
thought at times to be rather more free and easy
in his little sensualities than most bishops could
reasonably have approved of. On this latter account,
indeed, it was said that Mr. Brown, before-mentioned,
did not relish him for a son-in-law.
Ladies, however, are sometimes more charitable in
this respect; Miss Brown conceived that whatever
his <i>piety</i> might amount to, his <i>love</i>, at least, was
orthodox; and in this belief, she privately counselled
her swain to affect more holiness before her
papa:—to be lavish, for instance, in abuse of the
powers of darkness; to speak slower, and in a
more solemn tone; to get longer skirts made to
his coats and waistcoats, let his hair grow lank,
and say grace with becoming gravity and deliberation,—not
as if he were impatient to rush at the
eatables before they were properly blessed. “Eating,”
added the didactic lady, “may become a vice
if too luxuriously gratified; whereas hunger must
be a virtue, or the popes would not so strongly
recommend fasting.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At this stage of the treaty, and of the castle-building
on the foundation of a tan-yard, his reverence
was unfortunately seized in the cockloft by
Captain Murphy; and though the captain was a
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>neighbour of his, and a decent sort of cattle-dealer,
yet Parson Owen gave himself up for lost to
an absolute certainty. His love was, therefore,
quite quenched in horror: his throat swelled up
as if he had a quinsy, and he anticipated nothing
short of that which he had prayed against (like
Doctor Elgy) every Sunday since he obtained
holy orders—namely, a sudden death. He thought
repentance was, as the French say, <i>meilleur tard
que jamais</i>, and accordingly <i>began</i> to repent and
implore as hard as possible,—though without the
most remote idea that his supplications would have
time to reach heaven before he himself was turned
loose on the road thither.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Murphy, who, as we have seen, was,
although coarse, a <i>good-tempered</i> fellow, on entering
the room with half-a-dozen wattle-boys,
otherwise <i>executioners</i>, very civilly told Parson
Owen, “He would be obliged to him just to prepare
himself for the other world: whether the
other world was a <i>better</i> place or a <i>worse</i>, he
would not attempt to divine;—all he could <i>assure</i>
his reverence was, that he should not be very long
going there.—The boys below,” continued Captain
Murphy, “having a good many more to send
along with you to-day, your reverence will be so
good as to come down to the first floor as soon
as convenient, that you may drop more agreeably
from thence out of the window on the
pikes!”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>Without much ceremony, the poor parson was
handed down one flight of stairs, when Captain
Murphy opening a window as wide as he could,
begged Owen would be <i>kind enough</i> to take off his
coat and waistcoat, and throw them to the boys
below; the remainder of his dress they might
take from the corpse, after his reverence had
<i>stiffened</i>!</p>

<p class='c004'>The parson was nearly petrified; but there was
no appeal. The captain’s attendants civilly helped
him to remove his upper garments, for which
he had the pleasure of seeing an amusing scramble
under the window, accompanied by a hundred
jokes upon the little parson’s surtout, which not
being large enough for any middle-sized rebel, the
smallest fellow among them appropriated it, and
strutted about therein, amidst the horse-laughter
of his companions.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Murphy now ordered his wattlers to
draw up close under the window, in order to welcome
his reverence on the points of their weapons
as he went out head-foremost. The order was
promptly obeyed, with loud huzzas. The parson’s
legs were tied firmly together with a towel which
the captain found in the room; but his arms were
left loose, to flourish about (as they said) like a
<i>windmill</i>, and make the <i>sight</i> the more <i>agreeable</i>!</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, boys,” said the captain, “I’ll out with
his reverence; and when I let him go, do you all
<i>catch him</i>!”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>The parson was in good earnest thrust out of
the window, and hung with his head downward
and his arms at liberty, (a very disagreeable position,)
to the great amusement of the gentlemen
of the wattle, as was proved by a due mixture of
grins and shouts. If any of my readers have seen
a pack of hungry spaniels sitting on their haunches
round a sportsman’s table, looking up to their
master, and licking their jaws with impatience
for the morsel he holds in his fingers to throw
among them, they may imagine the enviable situation
of Parson Owen, dangling out of the grocer’s
window at the Bull-ring in Wexford;—Serjeant
Murphy meanwhile holding his legs, and now and
then giving him a little shake, as if he intended
to let him drop—asking his reverence if he were
<i>ready</i> to <i>step down</i> to the croppies.</p>

<p class='c004'>The condemned Lutheran was, of course, all
this time gazing with straining eyeballs upon
the forest of pikes underneath. His blood (as
if to witness the curiosity) rushed down to his
head; and he naturally fell into a state of delirium.
All he could recollect or relate afterward
was, that “as his eyes met the pikes just under
him, and heard the rebels call on the captain to
‘<i>let go!</i>’ the influx of blood to his brain operated
as, he should imagine, apoplexy might;”—and
the captain perceiving his prisoner to be senseless,
and actually intending, if possible, to save him,
cried out to the men below that “by J—s the
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>parson was ‘stone dead’ of the <i>fright</i>, and was
quite <i>kilt</i>!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hurrah!” cried the wattle-boys.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hurrah!” repeated Captain Murphy: “The
devil any use in dirtying your pikes with a dead
parson! Better not <i>spoil his clothes</i>, boys! his
shirt alone is worth a crown, if it’s worth a farthing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Some of the wattlers bespoke one garment—some
another:—and these were thrown out of the
window by Murphy, who left the poor parson in
his “birth-day suit,” with five times as much
blood in his head as it was anatomically entitled
to. The attendants in the room all thought he
was absolutely dead, and scampered down to
assist in the <i>scramble</i>. But Murphy, as he departed,
whispered to the owner of the house,
“The parson has life enough in him, yet! you
don’t think I intended to kill my neighbour, if I
could help it, do you? But if ever he <i>shows</i> again,
or any of ye tell a single word of this matter, by
J—s every living sowl shall be burnt into black
cinders!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The <i>defunct</i> was then covered with a quilt, carried
up to a back cockloft, and attended there by
the two old women who, in fact, alone occupied the
house. He remained safe and sound till the town
was retaken by General Lake, who immediately
hanged several disaffected gentlemen, cut off their
heads by martial law, and therewith ornamented
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>the entrance of the court-house, as heretofore described.
Parson Owen was now fully liberated,
with the only difference of having got a lank body,
confused brains, a celestial squint, and an illegitimate
sort of St. Vitus’s dance, commonly called a
<i>muscular contortion</i>, which, by occasional twitches
and jerks, imparted both to his features and limbs
considerable <i>variety</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>However, by the extraordinary caprice of Dame
Fortune, what the parson considered the most
dreadful incident of his life turned out, in one
respect, the most fortunate one. Mr. Brown, the
father of his charmer, was moved to pity by his
sufferings and escape, and still further conciliated
by the <i>twist</i> in his optic nerves, which gave the
good clergyman the appearance, whenever he
played the orator in his reading-desk or pulpit, of
looking steadfastly and devoutly up to heaven.
Hence he acquired the reputation of being marvellously
increased in godliness; and Miss Brown,
with her debentures, was at length committed to
his “holy keeping.” I believe, however, the
worthy man did not long survive to enjoy his
wished-for prosperity. St. Vitus grew too familiar;
and poor Owen became, successively, puny,
sickly, and imbecile: the idea of the pikes never
quitted his sensorium; and after a brief union,
he left his spouse a dashing young widow, to look
out for another helpmate, which I understand she
was not long in providing.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>Sudden fright and horror, or even agitating
news, have often the most extraordinary effect on
the human frame, exciting a variety of disorders,
and sometimes even death. I have myself seen
numerous examples of the overwhelming influence
of <i>surprise</i>. Not long since, a near relative of mine,
a clergyman of ample fortune—a pattern of benevolence
and hospitality—healthy, comely, happy,
and adored by his parishioners—had been driven
into some trifling lawsuit. He had conceived a
strange opinion, that a clergyman would be <i>disgraced</i>
by any cause he contested being given
<i>against</i> him. With this notion, he attached an
<i>ideal</i> importance to success; and the thing altogether
rendered him anxious and uneasy. The
day of decision at the assizes of Carlow came on:
he drove in his gig to the court-house door, quite
certain of the <i>justice</i> of his cause, and confident,
therefore, of its issue;—when the attorney who
acted for his opponent, coming out of court,
abruptly told him that the decision was adverse to
him. The extreme suddenness of this unexpected
news, like an electric shock, paralysed his frame,
extinguished all his faculties—and, in a word, he
instantaneously fell <i>dead</i>! The event was even
if possible more lamentable, as the intelligence
was communicated in sport. The cause had been
actually decided in my relation’s favour.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tendency of the imagination to <i>embody</i> character—Its frequent errors—Exemplified in the personal traits of several of the rebel chiefs of Ireland—The Bretons of La Vendée—Intrepidity of their leaders—The battle of Ross—Gallantry of a boy twelve years old—Beauchamp Bagenal Harvey—Description of his person and character—His habit of joking—Dangerous puns—His bewilderment as rebel generalissimo—His capture and behaviour at execution—Portrait, physical and mental, of Captain Keogh—Remarkable suicide of his brother, and his own execution—Mr. Grogan, of Johnstown Castle, described—His case, sentence, and execution—Unmerited fate of Sir Edward Crosby, Bart.</p>

<p class='c006'>When we read or hear of public and distinguished
characters, whether good or bad, we are
naturally disposed to draw in our mind a figure or
face for each, correspondent to the actions which
rendered the individual conspicuous. We are inclined,
for instance, to paint in our imagination a
rebel chieftain as an athletic powerful personage,
with a commanding presence;—an authoritative
voice to controul; and impetuous bravery to lead
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>on a tumultuous army of undisciplined insurgents.
Were this always the case, insurrections would,
perhaps, stand a better chance of being successful.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f39'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r39'>39</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Such <i>was</i> the case with the Bretons in La Vendée. An
officer of rank in the French army at that period, commanding
a regiment of chasseur republicans, told me very lately, that above
15,000 regular troops (his regiment among the rest) were surprised
at noon-day, defeated and dispersed, and their artillery
and baggage taken, by a <i>smaller</i> number of totally undisciplined
Vendeans, with few fire-arms, but led on by officers selected
for powerful strength and fiery enthusiasm. Their contempt for
life, and impetuosity in close combat, were irresistible; the latter,
indeed, was always a characteristic with them, and the gallantry
of their chiefs was quite unparalleled.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>In the Irish Rebellion of 1798, the chief leaders
had scarcely any of these attributes. <i>Numerically</i>,
the rebels were sufficient, and more than sufficient,
to effect all their objects; but they had no idea of
discipline, and little of subordination. Their intrepidity
was great, and their perseverance in the
midst of fire and slaughter truly astonishing. Yet
on every occasion it was obviously the <i>cause</i> and
not the <i>leaders</i> that spurred them into action:
when Irishmen <i>are</i> well officered they never
yield.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f40'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r40'>40</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The battle of Ross, in June, 1798, lasted ten hours. The
rebel <i>officers</i> did nothing, the <i>men</i> every thing. While the
commander-in-chief, Counsellor Bagenal Harvey, was standing
on a hill nearly a mile distant, a boy twelve years old (Lett of
Wexford town) called on the insurgents to follow him. He
put himself at the head of ten thousand men—approached the
town, and stormed it. The town took fire; the rebels got
liquor; and they were killed in sleep and drunkenness. Nothing
could have saved our troops had the rebels been well
officered: General Johnston, who commanded the royalists, deserved
great praise for his judgment on that critical occasion.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>A spirit of uncompromising fortitude or enthusiastic
gallantry generally spreads over the countenance
some characteristic trait. Undisciplined
followers are fascinated by ferocious bravery: they
rush blindly any where, after an intrepid leader.
But a languid eye, unbraced features, and unsteady
movements, palpably betray the absence of
that intellectual energy, and contempt of personal
danger, which are indispensable qualities for a rebel
chief.</p>

<p class='c004'>To reflect on the great number of respectable
and unfortunate gentlemen who lost their lives by
the hands of the common executioner in consequence
of that insurrection, is particularly sad;—indeed,
as melancholy as any thing connected with
the long misrule and consequent wretched state of
brave and sensitive Ireland—which is <i>now</i>, at the
termination of seven hundred years, in a state of
more alarming and powerful disquietude than at
any period since its first connexion with England.</p>

<p class='c004'>I had been, as stated in a former volume, in
long habits of friendship and intercourse with most
of the leading chiefs of that rebellion. Their features
and manners rise, as it were in a vision,
before my face: indeed, after thirty long years
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>of factious struggle and agitation, when nothing
remains of Ireland’s pride and independence but
the memory, every circumstance occasioning and
attending that period, and the subsequent <i>revolution</i>
of 1800, remains in freshest colours in the recollection
of a man who <i>once</i> prided himself on
being born an Irishman.</p>

<p class='c004'>I made allusion, in a previous part of this
work, to a dinner of which I partook in April,
1798, at Bargay Castle, County Wexford, the
seat of Beauchamp Bagenal Harvey,—who, I may
as well repeat here, was a month afterward general-in-chief
over an army of more than thirty
thousand men (mostly of his own county), brave
and enthusiastic; and, in two months more, died
by the hands of the hangman. He had been my
school and class-fellow, and from nine years of
age we held uninterrupted intercourse: he was a
most singular example of mixed and opposite
qualities; and of all human beings, I should least
have predicted for him such a course, or such a
catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c004'>Harvey was son of one of the six clerks of
chancery, who having amassed a very considerable
fortune, purchased the estate and castle of Bargay.</p>

<p class='c004'>Beauchamp Bagenal, his eldest son, was called
to the Irish bar, and succeeded to his father’s
estates. It was said that he was nearly related
by blood to that most extraordinary of all the
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>country gentlemen of Ireland, Beauchamp Bagenal,
of Dunlickry, whose splendour and eccentricities
were the admiration of the continent while he was
making the grand tour (then reserved as part of
the education of the very highest circles). This
relationship was the subject of much merriment
after a duel which Harvey’s reputed kinsman provoked
my friend to fight with him, in order to
have the satisfaction of ascertaining, “whether
or no the lad had metal.”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f41'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r41'>41</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. Bagenal provoked Harvey to challenge him. They
met. Harvey fired, and missed. “D—n you, you young rascal,”
cried Bagenal, “do you know that you had like to kill
your <i>god-father</i>? Go back to Dunlickry, you dog, and have
a good breakfast got ready for us. I only wanted to see if you
were <i>stout</i>.”</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Harvey’s person was extremely unimposing.
He was about five feet four inches in height; and
that ancient enemy of all beauty, the small-pox,
had shown him no mercy, every feature being
sadly crimped thereby. His sharp peaked chin
never approached toward a contact with his cravat,
but left a thin scraggy throat to give an
impoverished hungry cast to the whole contour, by
no means adapted to the mien and port of a
“commander of the forces.” His scanty hair
generally hung in straight flakes, and did not even
pretend to be an ornament to his visage; his eye
was quick but unmeaning; his figure thin and ill
put together; his limbs short, slight, and wabbling;
<span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span>his address cheerful, but tremulous. On
the whole, a more unprepossessing or unmartial-like
person was never moulded by capricious
nature.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet Harvey was a very good-tempered friendly
man, and a hearty companion. In common life
he was extremely well conducted, and in the society
of the bar often amusing, and never out of
humour.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was the greatest punster of his profession,
and piqued himself on that qualification, in which
he often succeeded admirably.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a> He had, in short,
that sort of partial popularity with his bar contemporaries
as rendered them always glad to have
him in their society; but it was seldom any one
inquired what had become of him when he
was out of it. He had an ample store of individual
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span>courage; feared not single combat, and
fought several duels intrepidly, though I do not
think he ever <i>provoked</i> one. He shot Sir Harding
Giffard, late Chief Justice of Ceylon, and obtained
a very droll name through that achievement,
which never forsook him during his lifetime.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f42'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r42'>42</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I cannot omit introducing here one of his puns, because he
ran a great risk of being <i>shot</i> for making it. A gentleman of
the bar, married to a lady who had lost all her front teeth, and
squinted so curiously that she appeared nearly blind, happened
to be speaking of another lady who had run away from her husband.
“Well,” said Harvey, “you have some <i>comfort</i> as to
<i>your</i> wife.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean, sir?” said the barrister.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I mean that if once you should lose Mrs. ——, you will
never be able to <i>i</i>-<i>dent</i>-ify her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>If Mr. —— had cared a farthing for his wife, it would have
been impossible to reconcile this joke to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The above was an inferior pun, but it was to the <i>point</i>, and
created great merriment.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Harvey was a person of the best fortune in his
quarter of the county; of a Protestant family;
and, being charitable and benevolent to his tenantry,
was much beloved by them. Nobody in
fact could dislike him: though he was flippant,
he did not want sense; and presented an excellent
example of those contradictory qualities so
often discoverable in the same individual. He
was considered by the heads of the United Irishmen
to be well adapted—as a man of fortune and
local influence in the most disaffected portion of
their strongest county—to forward their objects:
and he suffered his vanity so far to overcome
his judgment, as, without the slightest experience,
to assume the command of a great army—for
which purpose there were few men in Ireland
so utterly unfit.</p>

<p class='c004'>In his martial office, his head became totally
bewildered; the sphere of action was too great—the
object struggled for, too comprehensive. Nor
did even his <i>personal</i> courage follow him to the
field. His bravery, as against a single man, was
neutralised in a tumult; and a mind naturally
intrepid became bewildered, puzzled, and impotent.
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>Amidst the roar of cannon, and the hurly-burly
of the tumultuous and sanguinary battle of
Ross, his presence of mind wholly forsook him,
and he lost the day by want of tact and absence of
spirit. His men fought hand to hand in the
streets of Ross with the regular troops, of whom
they slew a considerable number, including the
Earl of Mountjoy; nor did they at last retire
until they had not a single officer left to continue
the engagement or lead them on to a renewed
attack—which in all probability would have been
effectual. Never did human beings show more
decided bravery than the Irish peasantry in that
bloody engagement. Thrice the town was theirs,
and was finally lost by their inebriety and want
of proper officers. Had Harvey captured New
Ross, all Munster would have risen in his cause;
and then indeed no royalist could have anticipated
without dread the consequences. Officers and
arms would have made the whole country inevitably
theirs. When Wexford was retaken, Harvey
concealed himself on an island, but was discovered,
brought to that town, and without much ceremony
hanged next day upon the bridge, toward
the erection of which he had largely subscribed.</p>

<p class='c004'>I could not but feel extreme regret at the sad
fate which befell my old friend and school-fellow,
who did not meet his destiny quite so firmly as
his original manly bearing had inclined people to
expect:—poor fellow! he idly strove by entreaty
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>to avert, or at least retard it; and its infliction
was aggravated by every species of indignity. In
every thing except his politics, Harvey’s character
was unimpeachable.</p>

<p class='c004'>I never knew two persons much more dissimilar
than were the commander-in-chief of the insurgents
and the rebel governor of Wexford,
Captain Keogh. The latter was a retired captain
of the British service, who had fought in America,
and, like many others, had there received a lesson
on <i>civil liberty</i> which never escaped his memory.
He was married to an aunt of Lady Barrington;
and, for many years, when I went the circuit, I
lived at his house, and had conceived the greatest
friendship for him. He was a very clever man.
His housekeeping was characterised by neatness,
regularity, and cheerfulness. Every thing was
good of its kind; and in that plentiful country,
even luxuries were abundant. Calm, determined,
moderate, and gentlemanly, Captain Keogh combined
good sense with firmness and spirit. But,
most unfortunately, ill-treatment sustained from
Lord Chancellor Clare perverted half his good
qualities, and metamorphosed him into a partizan,
which was far from being his natural tendency.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had a fine soldier-like person, above the
middle size; his countenance was excellent; his
features regular and engaging; his hair, rather
scanty, receded from his forehead; his eyes were
penetrating and expressive; and his complexion
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span>exhibited that partial ruddiness which we so frequently
see in fine men approaching threescore.
He was appointed rebel governor of Wexford,
but among those savages soon lost his popularity;
and had the insurgents continued much longer
masters of the place, he would surely have been
assassinated. He did what he durst on the side
of humanity, and had supposed that his orders
would be obeyed: but he was deceived; blood,
and blood in torrents, was the object of <i>both</i> parties
during that horrid summer. On the surrender
of the town, Keogh was immediately convicted
under martial law. He pleaded for himself; and
I learn that on that occasion every body was affected.
He knew his situation to be irretrievable,
and his life forfeit; and he conducted himself at
his execution with the utmost firmness, as became
a gentleman and a soldier. He was hanged
and beheaded on the bridge of which he also was
a proprietor; and his head, as mentioned in a
former volume (Vol. i.), was exhibited on a spike
over the court-house door.</p>

<p class='c004'>A singular circumstance occurred in Keogh’s
house while the rebels were in possession of Wexford.
His brother, a retired major in the British
army, had also served in America, and lived with
the captain in Wexford, but was a most enthusiastic
royalist. Upon the rebels taking the place,
he endeavoured to dissuade his brother from accepting
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span>the office of governor, but failing in the
attempt, he retired to his own room and immediately
blew his brains out!</p>

<p class='c004'>The next of my friends and connexions who
suffered by the hands of the executioner, was Mr.
Cornelius Grogan of Johnstown Castle, a gentleman
of large fortune, and great local interest and
connexion. He had been twice high-sheriff and
representative in Parliament for the county. He
resided three miles from Wexford at his castle,
where he had a deer-park of one thousand acres of
good ground, besides a fine demesne. He lived
as a quiet, though hospitable country gentleman.
At this unfortunate period he had passed his seventieth
year, and was such a martyr to the gout
that his hands were wrapped up in flannel; and
half carried, half hobbling upon crutches, he proceeded
to the place of execution.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Grogan was in person short and dark-complexioned.
His countenance, however, was not
disagreeable, and he had in every respect the address
and manners of a man of rank. His two
brothers commanded yeomanry corps. One of
them was killed at the head of his corps (the Castletown
cavalry) at the battle of Arklaw; the other
was wounded at the head of <i>his</i> troop (the Healtford
cavalry) during Major Maxwell’s retreat from
Wexford.</p>

<p class='c004'>The form of a trial was thought necessary by
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span>General Lake for a gentleman of so much importance
in his county. His case was afterward
brought before Parliament, and argued for three
successive days and nearly nights. His <i>crime</i>
consisted in having been surrounded by a rebel
army, which placed him under the surveillance of
numerous ruffians. They forced him one day
into the town on horseback;—a rebel of the appropriate
name of Savage always attending him
with a blunderbuss, and orders to shoot him if he
refused their commands. They one day nominated
him a <i>commissary</i>, knowing that his numerous
tenantry would be more willing in consequence
to supply them. He used no weapon of
any sort;—indeed, was too feeble even to <i>hold</i> one.
A lady of the name of Seagriff gave evidence that
her family were in want of food, and that she
got Mr. Grogan to give her an <i>order</i> for some
bread, which order was obeyed by the insurgents.
She procured some loaves, and supplied her children;
and for that bread (which saved a family
from starvation) Mr. Grogan was, on the lady’s
evidence, sentenced to die as a felon—and actually
hanged, when already almost lifeless from pain,
imprisonment, age, and brutal treatment! The
court-martial which tried him was not sworn,
and only mustered seven in number. <i>His</i> witness
was shot while on the way to give evidence of
his innocence; and while General Lake was
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>making merry with his staff, one of the first
gentlemen in the county (in every point his
superior) was done to death almost before his
windows!</p>

<p class='c004'>From my intimate knowledge of Mr. Grogan
for several years, I can venture to assert most unequivocally
(and it is but justice to his memory)
that, though a person of independent mind and
conduct as well as fortune, and an opposition
member of parliament, he was no more a <i>rebel</i> than
his brothers, who signalised themselves in battle
as <i>loyalists</i>; and the survivor of whom was <i>rewarded</i>
by a posthumous bill of attainder against the unfortunate
gentleman in question, by virtue of
which estates of many thousands per annum were
confiscated to the king. (The survivor’s admitted
<i>loyal</i> brother had been killed in battle only a
few days before the other was executed.) This
attainder was one of the most flagitious acts
ever promoted by any government:—but after ten
thousand pounds costs to crown officers, &amp;c. had
been extracted from the property, the estates were
restored. I spent the summer of 1799 at Johnstown
Castle, where I derived much private information
as to the most interesting events of that
unfortunate era.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is, of course, most painful to me to recollect
those persons whose lives were taken—some
fairly—some, as I think, unfairly—at a time when
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span>military law had no restraint, and enormities were
daily committed through it not much inferior to
those practised by the rebels.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir Edward Crosby, a baronet with whom I was
intimately acquainted, and who also lived tranquilly,
as a country gentleman, upon a moderate
fortune, near Carlow, was another person who
always struck me to have been <i>murdered</i> by martial
law. There was not even a rational <i>pretence</i>
for <i>his</i> execution. His trial, with all its attending
documents, has been published, and his innocence,
in fact, made manifest. The president of the martial
court was one Major Dennis, who some time
after quitted the service—I shall not mention why.
The sentence on Sir Edward was confirmed by Sir
Charles Asgill, I must suppose through gross misrepresentation,
as Sir Charles had himself known
enough about <i>hanging</i> (though personally innocent)
in America, to have rendered him more merciful,
or at least more cautious in executing the first
baronet of Ireland.</p>

<p class='c004'>The entire innocence of Sir Edward Crosby has
since, as I just now mentioned, been acknowledged
by all parties. His manners were mild and well-bred:
he was tall and genteel in appearance; and
upward of fifty years of age. He had a wife
who loved him; and was every way a happy
man till he was borne to execution without the
slightest cause. He was the elder brother of
my old college friend, Balloon Crosby, whom I
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>have heretofore mentioned in relating my <i>rencontre</i>
with Mr. Daly. (See Vol. ii.) He did not die with
the courage of Keogh, but hoped for mercy to the
last minute, relying on the interference of his old
friend Judge Downes, who, however, proved but a
broken reed.</p>

  <span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>
  <h2 class='c010'>REMINISCENCES OF WIT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Wit distinguished from ribaldry—Chief Baron Yelverton and Mr. Curran—Chief Justice Clonmell—Lord Norbury’s comprehensive powers—Sir Hercules Langreish, and his digressions in claret-drinking—Gervoise Parker Bushe, Chief Baron Burgh, &amp;c.—Peculiar traits of Irish convivial society in the author’s day—Jeremiah Keller—Lord Clare’s funeral—A scanty fee—The Pope and Pretender—Counsellor Norcott’s talent of mimickry—Ballinlaw ferry—Cæsar Colclough, of Duffry Hall, and Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no intellectual faculty so difficult to
define, or of which there are so many degrees and
gradations, as <i>wit</i>. Humour may be termed a
sort of <i>table d’hôte</i>, whereat wit and ribaldry sometimes
mingle. Certain eminent countrymen of
mine possessed these various conversational qualities
in great perfection, and often called them
into action at the same sitting. Among them,
Mr. Curran and Chief Baron Yelverton were most
conspicuous; but the flow of their <i>bonhomie</i> was
subject to many contingencies. It is worthy
notice, that all the Irish judges of those days who
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>could conjure up a single joke, affected <i>wit</i>. Lord
Clonmell, chief justice, was but clumsy at repartee,
though an efficient humourist. He seldom
rose above <i>anecdotes</i>, but these he <i>acted</i> whilst he
told them. He had the peculiar advantage of
knowing mankind well, and suiting his speech to
the ears of his company. Lord Norbury had witticisms,
puns, <i>jeux-d’esprit</i>—in short, jokes of all
kinds, constantly at hand. His impromptus were
sometimes excellent, but occasionally failed;—he
made, however, more <i>hits</i> than any one of
his contemporaries. Nobody, it is true, minded
much what he said:—if it was good, they laughed
heartily; if bad, it was only a <i>Norbury</i>;—and so,
by an indefatigable practice of <i>squibbing</i>, it is not
wonderful that, during a life of eighty years, he
should have uttered many <i>good things</i>—though,
oddly enough, few of them are preserved.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Norbury sang extremely well.—On my
first circuit as counsel, in 1787, he went as judge,
and I have often heard him warble “Black-eyed
Susan” and “Admiral Benbow,” as well as parts
in divers glees and catches, most agreeably.—Requiescat
in pace!</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir Hercules Langreish, a commissioner of revenue,
and one of the most popular <i>courtiers</i> of
our society, had an abundance of slow, kind-hearted,
though methodistically pronounced, repartee.
(A living friend of mine in high rank has
much more wit than Sir Hercules; but there is
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>less philanthropy about it). I have heretofore
mentioned his <i>retort courteous</i> to Mr. Dundas,
and will now give another specimen:—He was
surprised one evening at his house in Stephen’s
Green, by Sir John Parnell, Duigenan, and myself,
who went to him on an immaterial matter of revenue
business. We found him in his study alone,
poring over the national accounts, with two
claret bottles empty before him and a third bottle
on the wane; it was about eight o’clock in the
evening, and the butler, according to general orders
when gentlemen came in, brought a bottle
of claret to each of us. “Why,” said Parnell,
“Sir Heck, you have emptied <i>two bottles</i> already.”
“True,” said Sir Hercules. “And had you
nobody to help you?” “<i>O yes</i>, I had that bottle
of <i>port</i> there, and I assure you he afforded me very
great assistance!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Gervoise Parker Bushe could boast of wit
enough for a member of parliament, and more
than enough for a commissioner of the revenue.
An eminent relative of his, now living, possesses
the finest specimen I know at present of the
smooth, classical species.</p>

<p class='c004'>I never knew two distinguished individuals approach
each other so nearly in many respects as
the late Chief Baron Hussy Burgh and the personage
who now presides over the first law court
of Ireland. In some points, it is true, they differed:—the
former was proud, the latter affable.
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>The eloquence of the former was more highly
polished, more classical and effective; that of the
latter, more simple, more familiar, yet decided.
When very young, I was fascinated by the eloquence
of the <i>silver-tongued</i> orator (as he was then
called), and sought every possible opportunity of
hearing him both at the bar and in the House of
Commons. His was the purest declamation I
have ever listened to; and when he made an instrument
of his wit, it was pointed and acute.
He was a miscellaneous poet, and wrote epigrams
(several upon Lord Aldborough), which were extremely
severe, but at the same time extremely
humorous.</p>

<p class='c004'>It would be almost impossible to enumerate the
wits and humourists of Ireland in my early days.
Wit was then regularly <i>cultivated</i> as an accomplishment,
and was, in a greater or less degree, to
be found in every society. Those whom nature
had not blessed with that faculty (if a blessing it
is) still did their very best—as a foreigner sports
his broken English.</p>

<p class='c004'>The convivial circles of the higher orders of
Irish society, in fact, down to the year 1800, in
point of wit, pleasantry, good temper, and friendly
feeling, were pre-eminent; while the plentiful luxuries
of the table, and rich furniture of the wine-cellar,
were never surpassed, if equalled, among
the gentry of any country. But every thing is
now changed; that class of society is no more;
<span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span>neither men nor manners are the same; and even
the looking back at those times affords a man who
participated in their pleasures higher gratification
than do the actual enjoyments of the passing era.</p>

<p class='c004'>People may say this change is in myself: perhaps
so: yet I think that if it were possible for an
old man still to preserve unimpaired all the sensations
of youth, he would, were he a gentleman,
be of my way of thinking. As for those of my
contemporaries who survive, and who lived in
the same circles with myself, I have no doubt
they are unanimously of my opinion. I had very
lately an opportunity of seeing this powerfully exemplified
by a noble lord at my house. Good
fortune had attended him throughout life; always
respected and beloved, he had at length become
wealthy. When we talked over the days we had
spent in our own country, his eyes filled, and he confessed
to me his bitter repentance as to <i>the Union</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The members of the Irish bar were then collectively
the best home-educated persons in Ireland,
the elder sons of respectable families being
almost uniformly called to that profession. Among
them, nevertheless, were some of humbler origin.
Jeremiah Keller was such;—but his talent sufficed
to elevate him. He had the rare faculty of dressing
up the <i>severest</i> satire in the garb of pleasantry—a
faculty, by the bye, which makes no friends,
and often deepens and fixes animosity.</p>

<p class='c004'>Keller was a good man, generally liked, and
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span>popular with a considerable portion of his profession.
But though not rich, he occasionally exercised
an independence of mind and manners
which gave great distaste to the pride and arrogance
of some of the leading authorities. Lord
Clare could not endure him, and never missed an
opportunity of showing or affecting to show his
contempt for Jerry.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Clare having died <i>of the Union</i> and the
<i>Duke of Bedford</i>, it was proposed by his led captains
and partizans, that the bar, in a body,
should attend his funeral procession. But as his
Lordship had made so many inveterate foes at the
bar, by taking pains to prove himself <i>their</i> foe, it
was thought necessary to <i>canvass</i> the profession
individually, and ascertain who among them
would <i>object</i> to attend. Very few did;—not that
they cherished any personal respect for Lord
Clare, but wished to compliment the remains of
the first Irish chancellor. As Keller was known to
be obstinate as well as virulent, it was held desirable
to conciliate him if possible—though they
anticipated the certainty of a direct refusal.</p>

<p class='c004'>The deputation accordingly called on him:
“You know, my dear fellow,” said Arthur Chichester
M‘Courtney, who had been deputed as
spokesman (beating about the bush), “that Lord
Clare is to be buried to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“’Tis generally the last thing done with dead
chancellors,” said Keller coolly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>“He’ll be buried in St. Peter’s,” said the
spokesman.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then he’s going to a friend of the family,”
said Keller. “His father was a papist.”<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f43'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r43'>43</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Old Counsellor Fitzgibbon, Lord Clare’s father, was born
a Roman Catholic, and educated for a priest. His good sense,
however, opened his eyes to his own intellectual abilities; and
he determined to get, if possible, to the bar—that sure source of
promotion for reasoning talent. But when or where (if ever)
he renounced the Romish church, I am ignorant. He acquired
great and just eminence as a barrister, and made a large fortune.
Lord Clare was born his second son. Mrs. Jeffries (his sister)
I knew well, and I cannot pass her by here without saying,
that whatever faults she had, her female correctness was unquestioned;
and throughout my life I have never met a kinder-hearted
being than Mrs. Jeffries, or a fairer though a decided
enemy. Old Mr. Fitzgibbon loved to make money, and in his
day it was not the habit for lawyers to spend it. They used to
tell a story of him respecting a certain client who brought his
own brief and fee, that he might personally apologise for the
smallness of the latter. Fitzgibbon, on receiving the fee, looked
rather discontented. “I assure you, Counsellor,” said the
client (mournfully), “I am ashamed of its smallness; but in fact it
is all I have in the world.” “Oh! then,” said Fitzgibbon,
“you can do no more:—as it’s ‘all you have in the world,’—why—hem!—I
must—<i>take it!</i>”</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>This created a laugh disconcerting to the deputation;—however,
for fear of worse, the grand
question was then put. “My dear Keller,” said
the spokesman, “the bar mean to go in procession;
have you any objection to attend Lord
Clare’s funeral?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span>“None at all,” said Keller, “none at all! I
shall certainly attend his <i>funeral</i> with the <i>greatest
pleasure imaginable</i>!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Examples of Keller’s dry species of wit in fact
daily occurred; it was always pungent, and generally
well-timed. In the year 1798 flourished
Sir Judkin Fitzgerald, Bart., a barrister whose
loyal cruelties in the county of Tipperary were
made the subject of a <i>post facto</i> indemnity bill by
Lord Castlereagh, to save him from punishment.
Among other pastimes, he caused cats-o’-nine-tails
to be soaked in <i>brine</i>, that the peasantry and every
body else at whom he durst have a fling might be
better cut, and remember it the longer. Bragging
to Keller of his numerous ultra-loyal achievements,
this man said, “You must own, Keller,
at least, that I preserved the county of Tipperary.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ay, and you <i>pickled</i> it into the bargain!” said
Keller: “you promise to make so good a body
confectioner, that I dare say the lord-lieutenant
will hire you;” and in fact Sir Judkin was soon
afterward put in office at the castle.</p>

<p class='c004'>The unfortunate Counsellor Norcott, heretofore
mentioned in these sketches, was a fat, full-faced,
portly-looking person. He had a smirking countenance,
and a swaggering air; was an excellent
<i>bon vivant</i>, a remarkably good mimic, and affected
to be witty.</p>

<p class='c004'>Speaking of the Catholics in the hall of the Four
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>Courts, Keller seemed to insinuate that Norcott
was favourable to their emancipation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” said Norcott, with a great show of
pomposity—“what! Pray, Keller, do you see
any thing that smacks of the <i>Pope</i> about me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know,” replied Keller; “but at all
events there is a great deal of the <i>Pretender</i>, and
I always understood them to travel in company.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This was a kind of caustic wit which was not
much cultivated in the higher convivial societies
of that day, the members whereof used a more
cordial species. But such sallies were always
<i>repeated</i> with great glee when they did not affect
the person who repeated them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Norcott’s mimickry was complete. This is a disagreeable
and dangerous, because generally an
<i>offensive</i> faculty. The foibles, absurdities, or personal
defects of mankind are thus caricatured, and
the nearer perfection the mimickry, the more annoying
to the mimicked. Done in a man’s presence,
it amounts to a personal insult; in his absence,
it is dramatic backbiting,—a bad quality in
every point of view to cultivate, and such a weapon
of ill-nature as every body should assist in
blunting.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a company where the late Lord Chief Baron
Avonmore was a guest, Norcott was called on to
show his imitative powers. He did so with great
effect, taking off particularly well the peculiarities
of the judges; and when he had finished, Lord
<span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span>Avonmore said, with point, but good-humour,
“Upon my word, Norcott, as you so ably exposed
the absurdities of <i>eleven</i> of the judges, I think you
did not act fairly by us in not giving also the
<i>twelfth</i> of them” (his lordship’s self).—Norcott did
not utter a word more during the evening.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is very singular, that a man with such a
surplus of wit as Curran, never could write a good
epigram—nor, with such an emporium of language,
compose a pamphlet or essay that would pay for
the printing; while a very eminent living friend
of mine, high in the world—though not Curran’s
equal in either qualities—has written some of the
most agreeable and classic <i>jeux d’esprits</i>, of the
most witty and humorous papers, and most effective
pamphlets, that have issued from the pen of
any member of his profession during my time. I
had collected as many as I could of this gentleman’s
productions and sayings (several printed
and a few in manuscript); but, unfortunately, the
whole was lost in a trunk of mine, (with a great
number of my books and private papers and memoranda,)
in 1812. I can scarce attempt to recollect
any of them, save one or two, which may
give some idea, but nothing more, of the agreeable
playfulness of this gentleman’s fancy. They have
been long recorded by the Irish bar; and some of
the English bar, who are not at present celebrated
for their own impromptus or witticisms, and are
too <i>wise</i> and <i>steady</i> to <i>understand</i> those of Ireland
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span>(unless in print and after due consideration),
may be amused by reading and unriddling an
Irish epigram, sent into the world by an English

he always preferred a London edition of an Irish book, as he
thought, somehow or other, it helped to <i>take out the brogue</i>.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>A placard having been posted in the courts of
law in Dublin by a bookseller for the sale of
<i>Bibles</i>, the gentleman I allude to wrote instantly

<p class='c004'>Had the above <i>jeu d’esprit</i> been the impromptu
of a beaten client, he would have got great credit
for it; and in truth, I think, after a year or two
of litigation in a court of justice, most clients
would freely subscribe their names to the concluding
epithet.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another <i>jeu d’esprit</i> I remember, and so no doubt
do all the bar of my standing who have any recollection
left,—of whom, however, there is, I fancy,
no great number.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a very broad and boisterous ferry between
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>the counties of Wicklow and Wexford,
called Ballinlaw, which the Leinster bar, on circuit,
were obliged to cross in a bad boat. At
times the wind was extremely violent between the
hills, the waters high, and the passage dangerous;—yet
the <i>briefs</i> were at the other side; and many
a nervous barrister, who on a simple journey
would have rode a high-trotting horse fifty miles
round-about rather than cross Ballinlaw when the
waves were in an angry humour, yet, being sure
that there was a golden mine, and a phalanx of
attorneys brandishing their white briefs on the
opposite shore—commending himself to Divine
Providence, and flinging his saddle-bags into the
boat—has stepped in after them; and if he had
any prayers or curses by heart, now and then pronounced
a fragment of such in rotation as were
most familiar to him, on launching into an element
which he never drank and had a rooted aversion
to be upset in.</p>

<p class='c004'>The curious colloquy of a boatman, on one of
those boisterous passages, with Counsellor Cæsar
Colclough, once amused such of the passengers as
had not the fear of death before their eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cæsar Colclough of Duffry Hall, a very eccentric,
quiet character, not overwise, (he was afterward
Chief Justice of Newfoundland,) was in the
boat during a storm. Getting nervous, he could
not restrain his piety, and began to lisp out, “O
Lord!—O Lord!” breathing an ardent prayer
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span>that he might once more see his own house,
Duffry Hall, in safety, and taste a sweet barn-door
fowl or duck, of which he had fine breeds.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Arrah! Counsellor,” said the boatman, “don’t
be going on praying <i>that side</i>, if you plase; sure
it’s the <i>other lad</i> you ought to be praying to.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What <i>lad</i> do you mean?” said Colclough with
alarm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What lad! why, Counsellor, the old people
always say, that the <i>devil</i> takes care of his <i>own</i>;
and if you don’t vex him by praying the <i>other way</i>,
I really think, Counsellor, we have a pretty <i>safe</i>
cargo aboard at this present passage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The friend I alluded to, whose wit and pencil
were always ready, immediately placed Cæsar in a
much more classical point of view. Though he
made him a downright idolater, yet he put him on
a level with a mighty hero, or emperor—writing
upon the back of a letter thus:</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>Little did Julius Cæsar foresee before the birth
of Christ that the first man at the Irish bar would,
near two thousand years afterward, call to mind
his exploits in Gaul on the waves of Ballinlaw, in
the roaring of a hurricane. Should I meet him
hereafter, I shall certainly tell him the anecdote.</p>

<p class='c011'>Edward Lysight, Esq., barrister-at-law—His peculiar talents—A song of his contrasted with one of Moore’s on the same subject—<i>Ounagh</i> and <i>Mary</i>—Pastoral poetry—“The Devil in the Lantern”—A love story—“We’re a’ <i>noddin</i>”—Sketch of Mr. Solomon Salmon and his daughter—Mr. Lysight’s nuptials with the latter—Sociality at Somers’ Town—A morning call—All is not gold that glitters—Death of the counsellor and his lady.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the eccentric characters formerly
abounding at the Irish bar, was one whose species
of talent is nearly extinct, but whose singularities
are still recollected by such of his professional contemporaries
as have had the good fortune to survive
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Edward Lysight, a gentleman by birth, was
left, as to fortune, little else than his brains and
his pedigree. The latter, however, was of no sort
of use to him, and he seldom employed the former
to any lucrative purpose. He considered law as
his <i>trade</i>, and conviviality (to the cultivation
whereof no man could apply more sedulously) as
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>his <i>profession</i>. Full of point and repartee, every
humourist and <i>bon vivant</i> was his patron. He had
a full proportion of animal courage; and even the
fire-eaters of Tipperary never courted his animosity.
Songs, epigrams, and lampoons, which from
other pens would have terminated in mortal combat,
being considered inherent in <i>his</i> nature, were
universally tolerated.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some of Lysight’s sonnets had great merit, and
many of his national stanzas were singularly characteristic.
His “Sprig of shillelah and shamrock
so green” is admirably and truly descriptive of
the low Irish character, and never was that class so
well depicted in so few words: but, to my taste,
his sketch of a May morning is not to be exceeded
in that cheerful colouring and natural simplicity
which constitute the very essence and spirit of genuine
pastoral. The beginning of the copy of
verses called “Ounagh” offers an illustration of
this; and it is much to be lamented that, with
strange inconsistency, the man did not write another
line of it adapted for publication. The first
verse is, however, in my mind, worthy of being
recorded, and I give it as a sample either of my
bad or good taste. All I am <i>sure</i> of is, that <i>I</i> admire
it.</p>

      <div class='line'>’Twas on a fine May morning,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When violets were springing O,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dew-drops the fields adorning,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The birds melodious singing O:</div>
      <div class='line in6'><span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>The green trees</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Each soft breeze</div>
      <div class='line'>Was gently waving up and down:</div>
      <div class='line in6'>The primrose</div>
      <div class='line in6'>That sweet blows</div>
      <div class='line'>Adorned Nature’s verdant gown:</div>
      <div class='line in6'>The purling rill</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Stole down the hill,</div>
      <div class='line'>And softly murmur’d thro’ the grove,</div>
      <div class='line'>This was the time Ounagh stole out, to meet her barefoot love.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r45'>45</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pastoral poetry, whether classic, amatory, or merely rural,
owes its chief beauty to <i>simplicity</i>. Far-fetched points and
fantastic versification destroy its generic attribute; and their
use reminds one of the fashion of <i>harmonising</i> the popular melodies
of a country, in order that young ladies may screech
them with more complicated execution.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus, I prefer, upon the whole, my deceased friend Lysight’s
words written to an old tune, to those of my celebrated
living friend, Mr. Thomas Moore; and think the <i>Ounagh</i> of
the one likely to be quite as attractive a girl as the <i>Mary</i> of
the other, notwithstanding all the finery wherewith the mention
of the latter is invested. But our readers shall judge for themselves.
We have given the commencement of Mr. Lysight’s
version: here followeth that of Mr. Moore’s.</p>

      <div class='line'>The day had sunk in dim showers,</div>
      <div class='line'>But midnight now with “lustre meek”</div>
      <div class='line'>Illumin’d all the pale flowers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like hope that lights the mourner’s cheek.</div>
      <div class='line in6'>I said (while</div>
      <div class='line in6'>The moon’s smile</div>
      <div class='line'>Play’d o’er a stream in dimpling bliss)</div>
      <div class='line in6'>The moon looks</div>
      <div class='line in6'>On many brooks—</div>
      <div class='line'>The brook can see no moon but this.</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus I thought our fortunes run,</div>
      <div class='line'>For many a lover looks on thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>While, Oh! I feel there is but one—</div>
      <div class='line'>One Mary in the world for me!—</div>
    </div>

<p class='c004'>Had not my talented friend garnished the above ditty with
a note, admitting that he had pilfered his <i>Irish</i> Melody from
an <i>Englishman’s</i> brains (Sir William Jones’s), I should have
passed over so extravagant an attempt to <i>manufacture simplicity</i>.
I therefore hope my friend will in future either confide
in his own supreme talents, or not be so candid as to
spoil his song by his sincerity. “It is the devil (said Skirmish)
to desert; but it’s a d—d deal worse to <i>own</i> it!”</p>

<p class='c004'>I think Dean Swift’s sample of Love Songs (though written
near a century ago) has formed an admirable model for a number
of modern sonnets; it should be much esteemed, since it is
copied by so many of our minstrels.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lysight was, perhaps, not a poet in the strict
acceptation of the term;—but he wrote a great
number of miscellaneous verses—some of them,
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>in general estimation, excellent; some delicate,
some gross. I scarce ever saw two of these productions
of the same metre, and very few were of
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>the same character. Several of the best poetical
trifles in M‘Nally’s “Sherwood Forest” were
penned by Lysight.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having no fixed politics, or in truth <i>decided</i> principles
respecting any thing, he was one day a
patriot, the next a courtier, and wrote squibs both
<i>for</i> government and <i>against</i> it. The stanzas relatively
commencing,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Green were the fields that our forefathers dwelt on, &amp;c.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Where the loud cannons rattle, to battle we’ll go, &amp;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>and</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Some few years ago, though now she says no, &amp;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>were three of the best of his <i>patriotic</i> effusions; they
were certainly very exciting, and he sang them
with great effect. He ended his literary career
by a periodical paper in 1800, written principally
against me, and called “The Lantern,” for which
and similar squibs, he received four hundred
pounds from Lord Castlereagh. I sincerely wished
him joy of the acquisition, and told him “if he
found me a good chopping-block, he was heartily
welcome to hack away as long as he could get any
thing by his butchery.” He shook me heartily by
the hand, swore I was a “d—d good fellow,” and
the next day took me at my word by lampooning
me very sufficingly in a copy of verses entitled
“The Devil in the Lantern!” But I loved abuse,
when it was incurred for opposing the Union; and
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span>we never had a moment’s coolness upon that or
any other subject. Indeed, I really regarded him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He attempted to practise at the English bar;
but after a short time, told me he found he had
not law enough for the King’s Bench, was not dull
enough for the Court of Chancery, and that before
he could make way at the Old Bailey he must shoot
Garrow, which would be extremely disagreeable
to him. He therefore recurred to the periodicals;
and though an indifferent prose writer, wielded
his goose-quill with no small success. He showed
me a <i>tariff</i> of his pieces in verse: it was a most
pleasant document, and I greatly regret I did not
keep a copy of it: he burned it, he told me, to
light his candle with. So indifferent was he of
the main chance throughout life, that he never
adhered long to any pursuit after he found it was
really likely to be productive.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the year 1785, when I was at Temple, he
called on me one morning at the Grecian Coffee-house,
where I then lodged, and said, with much
seeming importance—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Barrington, put on your hat, and come along
with me this moment. I want to show you a lady
who has fallen in love with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In love with <i>you</i>, Ned?” said I.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ay, to insanity!” replied he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It must indeed be to <i>insanity</i>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh!” resumed he, gaily, “she is, I assure
you, only considering what death she shall inflict
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span>on herself if I do not marry her. Now, you
know, I am as poor as a rat, though a <i>gentleman</i>,
and her father is as rich as Crœsus, though a
<i>blackguard</i>: so we shall be well matched. The
blood and the fat duly mixed, as Hogarth says,
makes a right sort of pudding. So the thing is
settled, and I’ll have the twelve tribes of Israel at
my beck in the course of Monday morning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I thought he was distracted, and raving; but,
however, immediately set out with him upon this
singular expedition; and on our way to the
Strand, where <i>the papa</i> resided, he disclosed to me
all the circumstances of his amour.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Barrington,” said he, “the lady herself is not,
to be sure, the most <i>palatable</i> morsel one might see
in a circle of females; yet she is obviously of the
<i>human</i> species; has the usual features in her face
(such as they are), four fingers and a thumb on each
hand, and two distinct feet with a proper number
(I suppose) of toes upon each,—and what more
need I expect, seeing she has plenty of the
<i>shiners</i>?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“True,” said I: “as for beauty, those English
girls, who <i>are</i> handsome, are too frolicksome:
she’ll stick the closer to you, because she has
none.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what <i>advantage</i> will that be?” muttered
Lysight, with a half-suppressed imprecation. “Her
father pretends,” continued he, “to be a <i>Christian</i>,
and affects to keep a shop in the Strand,
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span>under the name of ‘<i>Salmon</i>, watchmaker:’ but in
reality he is a d—d Jew, and only pretends to
be a Christian that he may transact affairs for certain
Israelites of the city, who give him the devil’s
own rate of commission!—I hope to be a <i>partner</i>
ere long!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Suppose he receives <i>stolen goods</i>, Ned?” said
I. “You’d cut but a queer figure at the <i>tail of a
cart</i> with a cat-o’-nine-tails flourished over you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Father of Israel!” exclaimed Lysight, already
half a Jew, “you mistake the matter totally. No,
no! the maid-servant, whom I bribed with the
price of my last squib in the Chronicle, told me
every thing about Solomon Salmon—his dealings,
his daughter, and his great iron chest with eleven
locks to it: but as to <i>goods</i>, he never has fifty
pounds’ worth of trinkets or watches in his shop—only
a few in the window, to <i>look</i> like trade. He
deals in the lending and borrowing way only—all
<i>cash</i> transactions, depend on it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For Heaven’s sake, Ned,” said I, “how did
you introduce yourself into the family of a Hebrew?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I met the girl three months ago,” he replied,
“at a dancing-school at Somers’ Town, set up by
an old Irish acquaintance, Terry M‘Namara, with
whom I dine sometimes: he told me she was a rich
Jewess; so when I heard of her papa, I determined
to know something more about his daughter,
and stole frequently to Somers’ Town, where
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>Mr. Solomon Salmon has a pretty cit cottage.
There I hid behind a dead wall just in front, and
when <i>she</i> came to the window, I nodded, and she
ran away, as if offended. I knew this was a good
sign with a woman. She soon returned to the
window. I nodded again. Away went she a
second time; but I heard a loud laugh, and considered
that a capital sign: and in fact, she came
a third time. Then I was sure, and nodded <i>twice</i>,
whereupon she returned the salutation. Having
carried on the <i>nodding</i> system sufficiently, I now
ventured to speak to her on my fingers—an art
which I had seen her dexterously practise at
the dancing-school. ‘My love!’ fingered I; at
which she turned her back, but soon turned her
face again. ‘My love!’ I repeated, still on my
fingers. Off she scampered, but soon came back
in company with the maid-servant (whom I therefore
bribed next day). I now ventured to suggest
an interview the following evening. The Jewess
flushed at this proposal; but on my repetition of
it, held up <i>seven</i> of her fingers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course I was punctual at the time appointed,
was admitted, and we swore eternal fidelity
on the <i>Old</i> Testament. The maid betrayed us
as soon as I ran short of hush-money, but repented
afterward, when I gave her a fresh supply, and
told me that her master, Mr. Solomon Salmon, had
locked his daughter up. She had then attempted
to throw herself out of a two-pair window for my
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>sake; but the old Jew having caught her in the
very act, she peremptorily told him she was determined
to fall into a decay or consumption of the
lungs, if he did not consent to her marrying the
Christian counsellor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This he was in the sequel forced to agree to,
or sacrifice his own virgin daughter, (like the king in
the Bible,) besides whom he luckily has no other
child to inherit his fortune, and the mother is at
least twenty years past childbearing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“At length all was settled, and we are to be
actually married as Christians on Monday next.
Little Egar of Hare Court has drawn up the
marriage articles, and I am to have ten thousand
now—that is, the interest of it during the Jew’s
life, payable quarterly: then twenty more, and
<i>all the rest</i> on the mother’s death: and in the
mean time, half his commission on money dealings
(to commence after a few months’ instruction), together
with the house in Somers’ Town, where I
shall reside and transact business.”</p>

<p class='c004'>All this Lysight told me with great glee and
admirable humour.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Egad, it’s no bad hit, Ned,” said I; “many
a high-headed grand-juror on the Munster circuit
would marry Solomon Salmon himself upon the
same terms.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll dine with me,” said Lysight, “on
Wednesday, at Somers’ Town, at five o’clock? I’ll
give you a good turkey, and such a bottle of old
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span>black-strap as neither the Grecian nor the Oxford
ever had in their cellars for any money.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll surely attend a new scene, Ned,” answered
I.</p>

<p class='c004'>I was accordingly most punctual. All appeared
to be just as he had described. It was a small
house, well furnished. Miss’s visage, to be sure,
though not <i>frightful</i>, was less <i>ornamental</i> than any
article on the premises. The maid-servant was
really a fine girl; the cook no bad <i>artiste</i>; the
dinner good, and the wine capital. Two other
Templars were of the party, and every thing went
on well. About eight at night the old Jew came
in. He appeared a civil, smug, dapper, clean,
intelligent little fellow, with a bob-wig. He made
us all welcome, and soon retired to rest, leaving
us to a parting bottle.</p>

<p class='c004'>The affair proceeded prosperously; and I often
dined with my friend in the same cheerful manner.
Ned, in fact, became absolutely domestic. By
degrees he got into <i>the trade</i>; accepted all the
bills at the Jew’s request, to save <i>him</i> trouble, as
old Salmon kept his own books; and a large fortune
was accumulating every day, as was apparent
by the great quantities of miscellaneous property
which was sent in and as quickly disappeared;
when one morning, Ned was surprised at three
ugly-looking fellows entering his house rather unceremoniously
and without stating their business.
Ned immediately seized the poker, when his
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>arm was arrested gently by a fourth visitor, who
said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Easy, easy, Counsellor Lysight, we mean you
no harm or rudeness; we only do our duty. We
are the <i>commissioners’</i> messengers, that’s all. Gentlemen,”
said the <i>attorney</i>, as he proved to be, to
the three ruffians, “do your duty without the
slightest inconvenience to the counsellor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They then proceeded to seal up all the doors,
leaving Ned, wife, &amp; Co. a bed-room only, to console
themselves in. Mr. Solomon Salmon, in
truth, turned out both a Christian and a bankrupt,
and had several thousands to pay out of the sale
of about twoscore of silver watches and a few
trinkets—which constituted the entire of the splendid
property he had so liberally settled on Mr.
Edward Lysight as a portion with his lady daughter.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ned now found himself completely taken in,—reduced,
as he told me, to ten shillings and sixpence
in gold, and four shillings in silver, but
acceptor of bills of exchange for Salmon &amp; Co. for
more than he could pay should he live a hundred
years longer than the course of nature would permit
him. As he had signed no partnership deed, and
had no funds, they could not make him a bankrupt;
and as the bills had not arrived at mercantile
maturity, he had some days of grace during
which to consider himself at liberty:—so he
thought absence and fresh air better than hunger
and imprisonment, and therefore <i>retreat</i> the wisest
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>course to be taken. He was right; for in some
time, the creditors having ascertained that they
could get nothing of a cat but its skin, (even could
they catch it,) suffered him to remain unmolested
on his own promise—and a very safe one—that <i>if
ever he was able</i>, he would pay them.</p>

<p class='c004'>He afterward went over to Dublin to the Irish
bar, where he made nearly as many friends as
acquaintances, but not much money; and at
length died,—his widow soon following his example,
and leaving two daughters, who, I believe,
as teachers of music in Dublin, were much patronised
and regarded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several years subsequently, being surprised
that the creditors had let Lysight off so easily,
I inquired particulars from a solicitor who had
been concerned in the affairs of Salmon &amp; Co.,
and he informed me that all the parties, except
one, had ceased to proceed on the commission;
and that he found the true reason why the alleged
creditors had agreed to let Lysight alone
was, that they had been all engaged in a piece
of complicated machinery to deceive the unwary,
and dreaded lest matters should come out, in
the course of a strict examination, which might
place them in a more dangerous situation than
either the bankrupt or his son-in-law. In fact,
the creditors were a knot; the bankrupt an instrument;
and Lysight a tool.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>FATALITIES OF MARRIAGE.</h2>

<p class='c011'>Speculations of the author on free-agency and predestination—A novel theory—The matrimonial ladder—Advice to young lovers—A ball in Dublin—Unexpected arrival of Lord G— —His doom expressed—Marries the author’s niece—Remarks on his lordship’s character.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a previous part of this volume, I promised
my fair readers that I would endeavour to select
some little anecdotes of tender interest, more particularly
calculated for their perusal; and I now
proceed to redeem that promise, so far as I can.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Fatality</i> in <i>marriages</i> has been ever a favourite
theme with young ladies who have promptly determined
to resign their liberty to a stranger, rather
than preserve it with a parent. I am myself
no unqualified fatalist; but have struck out a
notion of my own on that subject, which is, I
believe, different from all others;—and when I
venture to broach it in conversation, I am generally
assured by the most didactic of the company,
that (so far as it is comprehensible) it excludes
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>both sense and morality. Nevertheless it is, like
my faith in supernaturals, a grounded and honest
opinion: and in all matters connected with such
shadowy things as spirits, fates, chances, &amp;c. a
man is surely warranted in forming his own theories—a
species of construction, at any rate, equally
harmless and rational with that castle-building in
the air so prevalent among his wiser acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is not my intention here to plunge deep into
my tenets. I only mean indeed to touch on them
so far as they bear upon matrimony: and may
the glance induce fair damsels, when first nourishing
a tender passion, to consider in time what
may be <i>fated</i> as the consequences of their <i>free-agency</i>!</p>

<p class='c004'>The matrimonial <i>ladder</i> (if I may be allowed
such a simile) has generally eight steps: viz. 1. Attentions;
2. Flirtation; 3. Courtship; 4. Breaking
the ice; 5. Popping the question; 6. The negotiation;
7. The ceremony; 8. The <i>repentance</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The grand basis of my doctrine is, that free-agency
and predestination are neither (as commonly
held) inconsistent nor incompatible; but,
on the contrary, intimately connected, and generally
copartners in producing human events.
Every important occurrence in the life of man or
woman (and matrimony is no <i>bagatelle</i>) partakes of
the nature of both. Great events may ever be
traced to trivial causes, or to voluntary actions;
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>and that which is <i>voluntary</i> cannot, it should
seem, be <i>predestined</i>: but when these acts of free-will
are once performed, they lead irresistibly to
ulterior things. Our free-agency then becomes
expended; our spontaneous actions cannot be retraced;
and then, and not before, the march of
<i>fate</i> commences.</p>

<p class='c004'>The medical doctrine of remote and proximate
causes of disease in the human body is not altogether
inappropriate to my dogma—since disorders
which are <i>predestined</i> to send ladies and gentlemen
on their travels to the other world, entirely <i>against</i>
their inclinations, may frequently be traced to
acts which were as entirely within their own option.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have already professed my intention of going
but superficially into this subject just now; and
though I could find it in my heart considerably to
prolong the inquiry, I will only give one or two
marked illustrations of my doctrine, merely to set
casuists conjecturing. There are comparatively
few important acts of a person’s life which may not
be avoided. For example:—if any man chooses
voluntarily to take a voyage to Nova Scotia, he
gives <i>predestination</i> a fair opportunity of drowning
him at sea, if it think proper; but if he determines
never to go into a ship, he may be perfectly certain
of his safety in <i>that</i> way. Again:—if a general
chooses to go into a battle, it is his free-agency
which enables predestination to despatch him
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>there; but if, on the other hand, he keeps clear
out of it (as some generals do), he may set fatality
at defiance on that point, and perhaps return with
as much glory as many of his comrades had acquired
by leaving their brains upon the field.
Cromwell told his soldiers the night before the
battle of Worcester, (to encourage them,) that,
“Every <i>bullet</i> carried its own <i>billet</i>.”—“Why then,
by my sowl,” said an Irish recruit, “that’s the very
rason I’ll <i>desert</i> before morning!” Marriage, likewise,
is an act of free-agency; but, as I said before,
being once contracted, predestination comes
into play, often despatching one or other of the
parties, either by grief, murder, or suicide, who
might have been safe and sound from all those
<i>fatalities</i>, had he or she never <i>voluntarily</i> purchased
or worn a plain gold ring.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of the eight steps attached to the ladder of
matrimony already specified, <i>seven</i> (all lovers will
be pleased to remark) imply “free-agency;” but
the latter of these being mounted, progress to the
eighth is too frequently <i>inevitable</i>. I therefore
recommend to all candidates for the ascent,
thorough deliberation, and a brief pause at each
successive step:—for, according to my way of
thinking, the knot tied at the seventh interval
should be considered, in every respect, perfectly
indissoluble.</p>

<p class='c004'>The principle of these few examples might extend
to most of the events that chequer our passage
<span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>through life; and a little unprejudiced reflection
seems alone requisite to demonstrate that
“free-agency” may readily keep fate under her
thumb on most important occasions.</p>

<p class='c004'>I cannot avoid particularising, as to matrimony,
an incident that came within my knowledge, and
related to individuals of rank who are still living.
The facts are well remembered, though they occurred
nearly twenty years ago. Exclusive of the
intrinsic interest of the transaction, it may have
some weight with my fair readers.</p>

<p class='c004'>About the year 1809, a ball, on an extensive
scale, was given by Lady Barrington in Dublin.
Almost every person of <i>ton</i> did her the honour of
participating in the festivity, and I think the Duke
of Wellington was present.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the evening, I received a note from Sir
Charles Ormsby, mentioning that Lord G——,
son of my old friend the Earl of L——, had just
arrived. He was represented as a fine young
man; and it was added that (though quite tired)
he might be prevailed on to attend Lady Barrington’s
ball, were I to write him a note of invitation.
Of course I did so with the greatest pleasure.
The Earl of L—— and I had been many years
intimate: the late Right Honourable Isaac Corry
was his close friend; and before his lordship grew
<i>too rich</i>, he was my next door neighbour in Harcourt
Street. We were, indeed, all three, boon
companions.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span>Lord G—— arrived at the ball, and a very
good-looking fellow he certainly was—of about
nineteen; his address corresponded with his
mien, and I was quite taken with him, independently
of his being my friend’s son. Two very
young relatives of mine—one my niece, Arabella
E——, the other my daughter (now the Viscomtesse
de F——,) did the juvenile honours of
the party.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir Charles Ormsby, (who might have been
termed a sort of <i>half-mounted</i> wit,) said to me, rather
late, “Did you ever know such a foolish boy
as G——? Before he had been half an hour in
the room, he protested that ere three months were
over, either one or other of your girls would be
Lady G——; that it was a <i>doomed</i> thing;—though
he could not exactly say <i>which</i> would be the bride—as
he had not seen either from the time they
were all children together.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The ball ended about day-break, and I was
obliged immediately to set off for circuit. I had
been engaged as counsel on the trial of Mr. Alcock
for the murder of Mr. John Colclough (as mentioned
Volume i.).</p>

<p class='c004'>I finished my month’s circuit at Wexford, where
to my surprise I found Lord G——. I asked him
his business there. He said he had been summoned
as a witness on the above-mentioned trial,
which I thought a very strange circumstance, as
he could have known nothing whatsoever of the
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>transaction. However, we travelled together to
Dublin in my carriage; and on the way he spoke
much of <i>destiny</i>, and of a cottage in County Wicklow,
with every thing “rural.” I did not then
comprehend the young man’s drift; but on my
return, I found that his <i>free-agency</i> had been put
in practice; and, in fact, very shortly after, Lord
G—— was my nephew. <i>Fatality</i> now commenced
her dominion; and a most charming gift from
fatality had the young nobleman received in a
partner juvenile, like himself, his equal in birth,
and possessed of every accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>I had not at first been made acquainted with
the cause of Lord G——’s visit to Ireland; but at
length understood, with some surprise, that the
Earl of L—— had placed his eldest son as an ensign
in a marching regiment ordered to the continent.
Thus, at the age of nineteen, he found himself
in a situation unfavourable, as I think, to the
fair and proper development of his mind and talents—uncongenial
with the befitting pursuits for a nobleman’s
heir—and still less adapted to gratify the
cravings of an ardent intelligent spirit, whose very
enthusiasm was calculated, under such circumstances,
to produce recklessness and evil.</p>

<p class='c004'>The residue of this <i>novel</i> (for such, in all its details,
it may fairly be denominated—and one of a
most interesting and affecting cast) would afford
ample material for observation: but it is too long,
too grave, and perhaps too delicate, for investigation
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>here.—Suffice it to add, that I saw Lord and
Lady G——, with their numerous and lovely family,
last summer on the continent—altered less than I
should have imagined, from the interval that had
elapsed. In speaking of his lordship, I am reminded
of the motto, “Every one has his fault:”—but
he has likewise great merits, and talent
which would have been higher had his education
been more judicious. My friendship for him has
been strong and invariable; and I think that fate
has not yet closed the book on his future renown
and advancement.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are few changes in the manners and
customs of society in Ireland more observable
than those relating to marriage. The day has
been, within my recollection, when that ceremony
was conducted altogether differently from the present
mode. Formerly, no damsel was <i>ashamed</i>,
as it were, of being married. The celebration
was joyous, public, and enlivened by every species
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span>of merriment and good cheer. The bride
and bridegroom, bridesmaids, and bridesmen (all
dressed and decorated in gay and gallant costumes),
vied in every effort to promote the pleasure
they were themselves participating. When
the ceremony was completed, by passing round
a final and mystical word, “Amazement!”—every
body kissed the bride. The company then all
saluted each other: cordial congratulations went
round, the music struck up, and plenty of plum
cake and wine seemed to anticipate a <i>christening</i>.
The bride for a moment whimpered and coloured;
the mamma wept with gratification; the bridesmaids
flushed with sympathy, and a scene was
produced almost too brilliant for modern apathy
even to gaze at. The substantial banquet soon
succeeded; hospitality was all alive; the bottle
circulated; the ball commenced; the bride led
off, to take leave of her celibacy; men’s souls
were softened; maidens’ hearts melted; Cupid
slily stole in, and I scarce ever saw a joyous
public wedding whereat he had not nearly expended
his quiver before three o’clock in the
morning. Every thing cheerful and innocent combined
to show the right side of human nature,
and to increase and perfect human happiness; a
jovial hot supper gave respite to the dancers and
time to escort Madam Bride to her nuptial-chamber—whither,
so long as company were permitted
to do so, we will attend her. The bed-curtains
<span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span>were adorned with festoons of ribbon. The chamber
was well lighted; and the bridesmaids having
administered to the bride her prescriptive refreshment
of white-wine posset, proceeded to remove her
left stocking and put it into her trembling hand:
they then whispered anew the mystical word before
mentioned; and having bound a handkerchief
over her eyes, to ensure her impartiality, all the
lovely spinsters surrounded the nuptial couch, each
anxiously expecting that the next moment would
anticipate her promotion to the same happy predicament
within three hundred and sixty-five days
at the very farthest. The bride then tossed the
prophetic hosiery at random among her palpitating
friends, and whichever damsel was so fortunate
as to receive the blow was declared the next
maiden in the room who would become devoted
to the joys of Hymen; and every one in company—both
ladies and gentlemen—afterward saluted
the cheek of the lucky girl. The ball then recommenced;
the <i>future</i> bride led off; night
waned;—and Phœbus generally peeped again
ere the company could be brought to separate.
Good-humoured tricks were also on those happy
occasions practised by arch girls upon the bridegroom.
In short, the pleasantry of our old marriages
in Ireland could not be exceeded. They
were always performed in the house of the lady’s
parents or of some relative. It would fill a volume
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>were I to enumerate the various joyful and happy
incidents I have witnessed at Irish weddings.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f46'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r46'>46</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How miserably has modern refinement reversed those scenes
of happiness and hilarity—when the gentry of my native land
were married in warm, cheerful chambers, and in the midst of
animated beings, beloving and beloved! No gloom was there:
every thing seemed to smile; and all thoughts of death or memoranda
of mortality were discarded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, those joyous scenes are shifted by sanctity and <i>civilisation</i>.
Now, the female soul almost shudders—and it well
may—on reaching the site of the connubial ceremony. The
long, chilling aisle, ornamented only by sculptured tablets and
tales of death and futurity, is terminated by the sombre chancel—whence
the unpupilled eye and vacant stare of cold
marble busts glare down on those of youth and animation,
seeming to say, “Vain, hapless couple! see me—behold your
fate!—the time is running now, and will not stop its
course a single moment till you are <i>my</i> companions!” Under
such auspices, the lovers’ vows are frozen ere they can be registered
by the recording angel.</p>

<p class='c004'>The cheerless ceremony concluded, the bridegroom solemnly
hands the silent bride into her travelling chariot; hurries her
to some country inn, with her pretty maid—perhaps destined to
be a future rival; they remain there a few days, till yawning
becomes too frequent, and the lady then returns to town a listless
matron—to receive, on her couch of <i>ennui</i>, a string of
formal congratulations, and predictions of connubial comfort,
few of which are doomed to be so <i>prophetic</i> as the <i>bridal
stocking</i> of her grandmother.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>At one of the old class of weddings took place
the most interesting incident of my early life, as
<span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span>I stated in a former volume. The spectacle and
events of that union never can be erased from
my memory, and its details furnish a good outline
wherefrom those of other marriages of that
period, in the same sphere of society, may be filled
up.</p>

<p class='c004'>In those days, so soon as an elder son came of
age, the father and he united to raise money to
pay off all family incumbrances. The money certainly
was raised, but the incumbrances were so
lazy, that in general they remained <i>in statu quo</i>.
The estates were soon clipped at both ends; the
father nibbling at one, the son pilfering at the other,
and the attorney at both. The rent-roll became
short; and it was decided that the son must marry
to “sow his wild oats,” and make another settlement
on younger children. Money, however, was
not always the main object of Irish marriages:—first,
because it was not always to be had; and
next, because if it was to be had, it would so soon
change masters, that it would be all the same
after a year or two. Good family, good cheer, and
beauty, when they could find it, were the chief
considerations of a country gentleman, whose blood
relatives, root and branch (as is still the case
on the continent), generally attended the act of
alliance, with all the splendour their tailors, milliners,
and mantua-makers could or would supply.</p>

<p class='c004'>My eldest brother (the bridegroom on the occasion
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>alluded to) was an officer of that once magnificent
regiment the black horse, and fell most
vehemently in love with the sister of a brother-officer,
afterward Colonel E—— of Old Court,
County Wicklow. I have described some beauties
in my former volumes; but the charms of
Alicia E—— were very different from the dazzling
loveliness of Myrtle Yates, or the opening bloom of
Maria Hartpool. She was inferior to either in symmetry;
but in interest had an infinite superiority
over both. Alicia was just eighteen: she had no
regular feature: her mouth was disproportionately
large; her lips were coral; her eyes destitute
of fire—but they were captivating tell-tales;
her figure was rather below the middle height, but
without an angle; and the round, graceful delicacy
of her limbs could not be surpassed. It was,
however, the unrivalled clearness of her pellucid
skin that gave a splendour and indescribable
charm to the contour of Alicia’s animated face.
I may be considered as exaggerating when I declare
that her countenance appeared nearly transparent,
and her hands were more clear than may
well be imagined. Her address was still more
engaging than her person.</p>

<p class='c004'>Such was the individual to whom my nut-brown
and unadorned D—— W——<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a> was selected as
bridesmaid. My brother was gentlemanly, handsome,
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span>and gallant, but wild; with little judgment
and a very moderate education.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f47'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r47'>47</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See Vol. i.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>It being determined that the wedding should be
upon a public and splendid scale, both families
prepared to act fully up to that resolution. The proper
trades-people were set to work; ribbon favours
were woven on a new plan; in fact, all Dublin
heard of the preparations from the busy milliners,
&amp;c.; and on the happy day, a crowd of neighbours
collected about my father’s house in Clare Street,
to see the cavalcade, which was to proceed to Old
Court House, near the Dargle, where the ceremony
was to be performed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dress of those days on such occasions was
generally splendid; but our garments “out-Heroded
Herod.” The bridegroom, cased in white
cloth with silver tissue, belaced and bespangled,
glittered like an eastern caliph. My mother, a
woman of high blood and breeding, and just pride,
was clad in what was called a <i>manteau</i> of silvered
satin: when standing direct before the lights,
she shone out as the reflector of a lamp; and as
she moved majestically about the room, and curtseyed
<i>à la Madame Pompadour</i>, the rustling of her
embroidered habit sounded like music appropriate
to the flow of compliments that enveloped her.
My father, one of the handsomest men of his day,
was much more plainly dressed than any of us.</p>

<p class='c004'>The gilded coach of ceremony (which I noticed
in an early sketch) was put in requisition; and its
<span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span>four blacks, Bully, Blackbird, the colt, and Stopford
(fourteen years of age), were all as sleek and
smooth as if cut out of ebony. Tom White and
Keeran Karry (postilions), with big Nicholas (the
footman), sported appropriate costumes; and the
whole was led by Mr. Mahony, the butler, mounted
on Brown Jack, my father’s hunter.</p>

<p class='c004'>The cavalcade started off at a hand-gallop for
Bray, accompanied by the benediction of old
Sarah the cook, and Judy Berger the hereditary
house-keeper, who stood praying meanwhile, and
crossing their foreheads, at the door. An old travelling
chaise of no very prepossessing appearance
(which had been rescued from the cocks and hens
in the country out-house), with a pair of hacks, was
driven by Matthew Querns the huntsman, and
contained the residue of the party—namely, my
two other brethren and self.</p>

<p class='c004'>The more particular description of our attire
may strike certain <i>moderns</i> as somewhat ridiculous;
but that attire was in the <i>goût</i> of the
day, and covered as good proportions as those
of the new gentry who may deride it. The men
wore no stays; the ladies covered their shoulders;
and the first were to the full as brave, and the
latter at least as modest, as their successors. <i>Our</i>
wedding suits were literally thus composed. The
blue satin vests and inexpressibles were well
laced and spangled wherever there was any
room for ornament. The coats were of white
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>cloth with blue capes. Four large paste curls,
white as snow with true rice powder, and scented
strong with real bergamot, adorned our heads.
My third brother, Wheeler Barrington, had a coat
of scarlet cloth, because he was <i>intended</i> for the
army.</p>

<p class='c004'>In truth, greater luminaries never attended a
marriage festivity. Our equipage, however, by
no means corresponded with our personal splendour
and attractions; and I thought the contrast
would be too ridiculous to any observing spectator
who might know the family. I therefore desired
Matthew to take a short turn from the great rock
road to avoid notice as much as possible; which
caution being given, we crowded into the tattered
vehicle, and trotted away as swiftly as one blind
and one lame horse could draw such magnificoes.
There were (and are) on the circular
road by which I had desired Matthew Querns to
drive us, some of those nuisances called turnpikes.
When we had passed the second gate, the gatekeeper,
who had been placed there recently, of
course demanded his toll. “Pay him, French,”
said I to my brother. “Faith,” said French, “I
changed my clothes, and I happen to have no
money in my pocket.” “No matter,” answered I,
“Wheeler, give the fellow a shilling.” “I have
not a rap,” said Wheeler.—“I lost every halfpenny
I had yesterday at the royal cockpit in
Essex Street.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span>By a sort of instinct I put my hand into my
own pocket; but instinct is not money, and <i>reality</i>
quickly informed me that I was exactly in
the same situation. However, “no matter,” again
said I; so I desired old Matthew Querns to pay
the turnpike. “Is it me pay the pike?” said
Matthew—“me? the devil a cross of wages I got
from the master this many a day; and if I did, do
you think, Master Jonah, the liquor would not be
after having it out of me by this time?” and he
then attempted to drive on <i>without</i> paying, as he
used to do at Cullenaghmore. The man however
grappled the blind horse, and gave us a full quantum
of abuse, in which his wife, who issued forth
at the sound, vociferously joined. Matthew began
to whack him and the horses alternately with his
thong whip; my brother French struggled to get
out, and beat the pike-man; but the door would
not open readily, and I told him that if he beat
the turnpike man properly, he’d probably bleed
<i>a few</i> himself; and that a single drop of blood on
his fine clothes would effectually exclude him from
society. This reasoning succeeded; but the blind
horse not perceiving what was the matter, supposed
something worse had happened, and began
to plunge and break the harness. “You d—d gilt
vagabonds,” said the turnpike man, “such fellows
should be put into the stocks or ducked at
the broad stone beyond Kilmainham. Oh! I know
you well enough! (looking into the carriage window:)
<span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span>what are yees but stage-players that have
run away from Smock Alley, and want to impose
upon the country-folk!—But I’ll neither let
yees back or forward, by ——, till you pay me a <i>hog</i>
for the pike, and two and eightpence-halfpenny
for every wallop of the whip that the ould green
mummer there gave me, when I only wanted my
honest dues.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I saw fighting was in vain; but courtesy can do
any thing with an Irishman. “My honest friend,”
said I, (to soften him,) “you’re right; we are poor
stage-players sure enough: we have got a loan of
the clothes from Mr. Ryder—may Heaven bless
him! and we’re hired out to play a farce for a
great wedding that’s to be performed at Bray
to-night. When we come back with our money
we’ll pay you true and fair, and drink with you
till you’re stiff, if you think proper.”</p>

<p class='c004'>On this civil address the pike-man looked very
kind: “Why, then, by my sowl it’s true enough,”
said he, “ye can’t be very rich till ye get your
entrance money; but sure I won’t be out of pocket
for all that. Well, faith and troth, ye look like
decent stage-players; and I’ll tell you what, I
like good music, so I do. Give me a new song
or two, and d—mme but I’ll let you off, you poor
craturs, till you come back agin. Come, give
us a chaunt, and I’ll help you to mend the
harness too!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you, sir,” said I humbly. “I can’t
<span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span>sing,” said my brother French, “unless I’m
drunk!” “Nor I, drunk or sober,” said Wheeler.
“You <i>must</i> sing for the <i>pike</i>,” said I to French;
and at length he set up his pipes to a favourite
song, often heard among the half-mounted gentlemen
in the country when they were drinking;
and as I shall never forget any incident of that
(to me) eventful day, and the ditty is quite
characteristic both of the nation generally and
the half-mounted gentlemen in particular, (with
whom it was a sort of charter song,) I shall
give it.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>D—n money—it’s nothing but trash:</div>
      <div class='line'>We’re happy though ever so poor!</div>
      <div class='line'>When we have it we cut a great dash,</div>
      <div class='line'>When it’s gone, we ne’er think of it more.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then let us be wealthy or not,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our spirits are always the same;</div>
      <div class='line'>We’re free from every dull thought,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the “Boys of old Ireland’s” our name!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>I never saw a poor fellow so pleased as the
pike-man; the words hit his fancy: he shook us
all round, most heartily, by the hand; and running
into his lodge, brought out a pewter pot of frothing
beer, which he had just got for himself, and
insisted on each of us taking a drink. We of
course complied. He gave Matthew a drink too,
and desired him not to be so handy with his whip
to other pike-men, or they’d <i>justice</i> him at Kilmainham.
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span>He then helped up our traces; and
Matthew meanwhile, who, having had the last
draught, had left the pot no further means of
exercising its hospitality—enlivened by the liquor
and encouraged by the good-nature of the pike-man,
and his pardon for the <i>walloping</i>—thought
the least he could do in gratitude was to give the
honest man a sample of his own music, vocal and
instrumental: so taking his hunting horn from
under his coat (he never went a yard without it)
and sounding his best “Death of Reynard,” he
sang a stave which was then the charter song of
<i>his</i> rank, and which he roared away with all the
graces of a view holloa:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>Ho! ro! the sup of good drink!</div>

      <div class='line'>Oh! had I a shilling lapp’d up in a clout,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis a sup of good drink that should wheedle it out.</div>
      <div class='line in22'>And it’s ho! ro! &amp;c. &amp;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The man of the pike was delighted. “Why,
then, by my sowl, you ould mummer,” said he,
“it’s a pity the likes of you should <i>want</i> a <i>hog</i>.
Arrah! here (handing him a shilling), maybe your
whistle would run dry on the road, and you’ll
pay me when you come back, won’t you? Now
all’s settled, off wid yees! Success!—success!”
And away we went, as fast as the halt and blind
could convey us.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span>We arrived safe and in high glee, just as the
prayer-book was getting ready for the ceremony.
I apologised for our apparent delay by telling the
whole story in my own manner. D— W— seemed
wonderfully amused. I caught her eye: it was not
like Desdemona’s; but she told me afterward, that
my <i>odd</i> mode of relating that adventure first
made her remark me as a singularity. She was
so witty on it herself, that she was the cause of
wit in me. She was indefatigable at sallies—I
not idle at repartee; and we both amused ourselves
and entertained the company.</p>

<p class='c004'>I sat next to D— W— at dinner; danced with
her at the ball; pledged her at supper; and before
two o’clock in the morning my heart had
entirely deserted its master.</p>

<p class='c004'>I will here state, by way of episode, that great
difficulties and delays, both of law and equity, had
postponed the matrimonial connexion of my brother,
Major Barrington (he bore that rank in the
old volunteers), for a considerable time. There
was not money enough <i>afloat</i> to settle family incumbrances,
and keep the younger children from
starving. A temporary suspension was of course
put to the courtship. My brother in consequence
grew nearly outrageous, and swore to me that he
had not slept a wink for three nights, considering
what species of <i>death</i> he should put himself to.
Strong, and young, (though tolerably susceptible
myself,) my heart was at that time my own, and I
<span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span>could not help laughing at the extravagance of his
passion. I tried to ridicule him out of it. “Heavens!”
said I, “Jack, how can you be at a loss on
<i>that</i> score? You know I am pretty sure that, by
your intended suicide, I shall get a step nearer
Cullenaghmore. Therefore, I will remind you that
there are a hundred very <i>genteel</i> ways by which
you may despatch yourself without either delay or
expense.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked at me quite wildly. In fact he was
distractedly in love. Alicia was eternally on his
lips, and I really believe, if his head had been
cut off like the man’s in Alonzo de Cordova, it
would have continued pronouncing “Alicia,” till
every drop of blood was clean out of it. Reasoning
with a mad lover is in vain, so I still pursued
ridicule. “See,” said I, “that marble chimney-piece
at the end of the room; suppose, now, you
run head-foremost against it,—in all human probability
you’ll knock your brains out in a novel
and not at all a vulgar way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I spoke in jest, but found my hearer jested not.
Before I could utter another word, he bent his
head forward, and with might and main rushed
plump at the chimney-piece, which he came
against with a crash that I had no doubt must
have finished him completely. He fell back and
lay without a struggle; the blood gushed, and I
stood petrified. The moment I was able I darted
out of the room, and calling for aid, his servant
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>Neil came. I told him that his master was
dead.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dead!” said Neil, “By —— he is, and
<i>double dead</i> too! Ah! then, who <i>kilt</i> the major?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He took him up in his arms, and laid him on a
sofa. My brother, however, soon gave Neil the
“retort courteous.” He opened his eyes, groaned,
and appeared any thing but <i>dying</i>. My fright
ceased; he had been only stunned, and his head
cut, but his brains were safe in their case. He
had luckily come in contact with the <i>flat</i> part of
the marble: had he hit the <i>moulding</i>, he would
have ended his love and misfortunes together, and
given me, as I had said, a step toward Cullenaghmore.
The cut on his head was not material, and
in a few days he was tolerably well again. This
story, however, was not to be divulged; it was
determined that it should remain with us a great
secret. Neil, his servant, we swore on a bible not
to say a word about it to any body; but the honest
man must have practised some mental reservation,
as he <i>happened</i> just only to <i>hint</i> it to his sweetheart,
Mary Donnellan, my mother’s maid, and she
in a tender moment told the postilion Keeran, for
whom she had a regard. Keeran never kept a
secret in all his life; so he told the dairy-maid,
Molly Coyle, whom he preferred to Mary Donnellan.
And the dairy-maid told my father, who frequented
the dairy, and delighted to see Molly
Coyle a-churning. The thing at length became
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span>quite public; and my brother, to avoid raillery, set
off to his regiment at Philipstown, whither I accompanied
him. He still raved about taking the first
favourable <i>opportunity</i> of putting himself to death, if
the courtship were much longer suspended; and
spoke of gallantly throwing himself off his charger
at full gallop, previously fastening his foot in the
stirrup. The being dragged head downwards over
a few heaps of paving stones would certainly have
answered his deadly purpose well enough; but I
dissuaded him without much difficulty from that
species of self-murder, by assuring him that every
body, in such a case, would attribute his death to
<i>bad horsemanship</i>, which would remain, on the records
of the regiment, an eternal disgrace to his
professional character. Many other projects he
thought of; but I must here make one remark,
which perhaps may be a good one in general—namely,
that every one of those projects <i>happened</i>
to originate <i>after dinner</i>—a period when Irishmen’s
chivalric fancies are at their most enthusiastic and
visionary height.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length, a happy letter reached the major,
signifying that all parties had agreed, and that his
Alicia, heart and hand, was to be given up to him
for life, as his own private and exclusive property—“to
have and to hold, for better for worse,” &amp;c.
&amp;c. This announcement rendered him almost as
wild as his despair had done previously. When
he received the letter, he leaped down a flight of
<span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span>stairs at one spring, and in five minutes ordered
his charger to be saddled for himself; his hunter,
“Mad Tom,” for me; and his chestnut, “Rainbow,”
for Neil. In ten minutes we were all
mounted and in full gallop toward Dublin, which
he had determined to reach that night after one
short stoppage at Kildare, where we arrived
(without slackening rein) in as short a time as if
we had rode a race. The horses were fed well,
and drenched with hot ale and brandy; but as
none of them were in love, I perceived that
they would willingly have deferred the residue of
the journey till the ensuing morning. Indeed,
my brother’s steed conceiving that <i>charges</i> of
such rapidity and length were not at all military,
unless in <i>running away</i>, determined practically
to convince his master that such was his notion.
We passed over the famous race-ground of the Curragh
in good style; but, as my brother had not
given his horse time to lie down gently and rest
himself in the ordinary way, the animal had no
choice but to perform the feat of lying down
whilst in full gallop—which he did very expertly
just at the Curragh stand-house. The only mischief
occurring herefrom was, that the drowsy
charger stripped the skin, like rags, completely
off both his knees, scalped the top of his head,
got a hurt in the back sinews, and (no doubt without
intending it) broke both my brother’s collarbones.
When we came up (who were a few hundred
yards behind him), both man and beast were
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>lying very quietly, as if asleep;—my brother
about five or six yards before the horse, who had
cleverly thrown his rider far beyond the chance
of being tumbled over by himself. The result
was, as usual on similar occasions, that the horse
was led limping and looking foolish to the first
stable, and committed to all the farriers and
grooms in the neighbourhood. My brother was
carried flat on a door to the nearest ale-house;
and doctors being sent for, <i>three</i> (with bags of instruments)
arrived from different places before
night, and, after a good deal of searching and fumbling
about his person, one of them discovered
that both collar-bones were smashed, as aforesaid,
and that if either of the broken bones or splinters
thereof turned <i>inward</i> by his stirring, it might run
through the lobes of his lungs, and very suddenly
end all hopes of ever completing his journey: his
nose had likewise taken a different turn from that
it had presented when he set out:—and the palms
of his hands fully proved that they could do without
any skin, and with a very moderate quantity of
flesh.</p>

<p class='c004'>However, the bones were well arranged, a pillow
strapped under each arm, and another at his
shoulder-blades. All necessary comforts were procured,
as well as furniture from Mr. Hamilton,
whose house was near. I did not hear a word
that night about Alicia; but in due time the
major began to recover once more, and resumed
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span>his love, which had <i>pro tempore</i> been literally
knocked out of him. It was announced by the
doctor that it would be a long time before he
could use his hands or arms, and that removal or
exercise might produce a new fracture, and send a
splinter or bone through any part of his interior
that might be most handy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Though I thought the blood he had lost, and the
tortures the doctor put him to, had rendered his
mind a good deal tamer than it was at Maryborough,
he still talked much of Alicia, and proposed
that I should write to her, on his part, an
account of his misfortunes; and the doctor in
attendance allowing him the slight exertion of
signing his name and address in his own handwriting,
I undertook to execute my task to the
utmost of my skill, and certainly performed it with
great success. I commenced with due warmth,
and stated that the “accident he had met with
only retarded the happiness he should have in
making her his wife, which he had so long burned
for, but which circumstances till then had prevented,”
&amp;c. &amp;c. (The words I recollect pretty
well, because they afterward afforded me infinite
amusement.) The letter was sealed with the
family arms and crest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, Jonah,” said my brother, “before I
marry I have a matter of some importance to
arrange, lest it should come to the ears of my
Alicia, which would be my ruin; and I must get
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span>you to see it settled for me at Philipstown, so
as to prevent any thing exploding.” He went on
to give me the particulars of a certain <i>liaison</i> he
had formed with a young woman there, an exciseman’s
daughter, which he was now, as may be
supposed, desirous of breaking; and (though protesting
that interference in such matters was not
at all to my taste) I consented to write, at his
dictation, a sort of compromise to the party, which
he having signed, both epistles were directed at
the same time, and committed to the post-office of
Kilcullen bridge.</p>

<p class='c004'>The amorous and fractured invalid was now
rapidly advancing to a state of convalescence. His
nose had been renovated with but an inconsiderable
partiality for the left cheek; his collar-bones
had approximated to a state of adhesion; and he
began impatiently to count the days and nights
that would metamorphose his Alicia from a spinster
to a matron.</p>

<p class='c004'>The extravagance of his flaming love amused
me extremely: his aerial castles were built, altered,
and demolished with all the skill and rapidity of
modern architecture; while years of exquisite
and unalloyed felicity arose before his fancy, of
which they took an immovable grasp.</p>

<p class='c004'>We were busily engaged one morning in planning
and arranging his intended establishment, on
returning to the sports and freaks of a country
gentleman (with the addition of a terrestrial angel
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>to do the honours), when, on a sudden, we heard
rather a rough noise at the entrance of the little
chamber wherein the invalid was still reclining upon
a feather-bed, with a pillow under each arm to keep
the bones in due position. Our old fat landlady,
who was extremely partial to the cornet,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a> burst
in with her back toward us, endeavouring to prevent
the entrance of a stranger, who, however,
without the least ceremony, giving her a hearty
curse, dashed into the centre of the room in a
state of bloated rage scarcely conceivable—which
was more extraordinary as the individual appeared
to be no other than Captain Tennyson Edwards,
of the 30th regiment, third brother of the beloved
Alicia. Of course we both rose to welcome him
most heartily: this however he gave us no opportunity
of doing; but laying down a small mahogany
case, which he carried in his hand, and
putting his arms akimbo, he loudly exclaimed
without any exordium, “Why, then, Cornet Jack
Barrington, are you not the greatest scoundrel
that ever disgraced civilised society?”</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f48'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r48'>48</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My brother’s <i>actual</i> rank in <i>the army</i>.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>This quere of course was not answered in the
affirmative by either of us; and a scene of astonishment
on the one side and increasing passion
on the other, baffled all common-place description:
I must therefore refer it to the imagination of my
readers. The retort courteous was over and over
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>reiterated on both sides without the slightest attempt
at any <i>éclaircissement</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length the captain opened his mahogany
case, and exhibited therein a pair of what he
called his “barking irons,” bright and glittering
as if both able and willing to commit most expertly
any murder or murders they might be employed
in.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You scoundrel!” vociferated the captain to the
cornet, “only that your bones were smashed by
your horse, I would not leave a whole one this
day in your body. But I suppose your brother
here will have no objection to exchange shots <i>for</i>
you, and not keep me waiting till you are well
enough to be <i>stiffened</i>! Have you any objection
(turning to me) ‘to take a <i>crack</i>?’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A very considerable objection,” answered I;
“first, because I never fight without knowing <i>why</i>;
and secondly, because my brother is not in the
habit of fighting by proxy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not know why?” roared the captain. “There!
read that! Oh! I wish you were hale and
whole, cornet, that I might have the pleasure of
a <i>crack</i> with <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p class='c004'>I lost no time in reading the letter; and at once
perceived that my unlucky relative had, in the
flurry of his love, misdirected each of the two
epistles just now spoken of, and consequently informed
“the divine Alicia” that he could hold no
further intercourse with her, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span>A fit of convulsive laughter involuntarily seized
me, which nothing could restrain; and the captain
meanwhile, nearly bursting with rage, reinvited
me to be shot at. My brother stood all the time
like a ghost, in more pain, and almost in as great
a passion as our visitor. He was unable to articulate;
and the pillows fixed under each arm
rendered him one of the most grotesque figures
that a painter could fancy.</p>

<p class='c004'>When I recovered the power of speaking (which
was not speedily), I desired Tennyson to follow
me to another room: he took up his pistol-case,
and expecting I was about to indulge him with a
<i>crack</i> or two, seemed somewhat easier in mind
and temper. I at once explained to him the
curious mistake, and without the least hesitation
the captain burst into a much stronger paroxysm
of laughter than I had just escaped from. Never
did any officer in the king’s service enjoy a victory
more than Captain Edwards did this strange
blunder. It was quite to his taste, and on our
proposing to make the invalid as happy as exhaustion
and fractures would admit of, a new scene,
equally unexpected, but of more serious consequences,
turned up.</p>

<p class='c004'>A ruddy, active and handsome country girl came
to the door, and sprang with rapidity from a pillion
on which she had been riding behind a good-looking
rustic lad. Our landlady greeted her new
customer with her usual urbanity. “You’re welcome
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span>to these parts, miss,” said Mrs. Mahony:
“you stop to-night—to be sure you do:—what do
you choose, miss?—Clean out the settle-bed parlour:—the
chickens and rashers, miss, are capital,
so they are.—Gassoon, do run and howld the
lady’s beast; go, avourneen, carry him in and
wipe him well—do you hear? and throw a wisp of
hay before the poor brute. You rode hard, miss,
so you did!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh! where’s the cornet?” cried the impatient
maiden, totally disregarding Mrs. Mahony: for it
was Jenny —— herself, who had come speedily
from Philipstown to forestall the happy moments
which my bewildered brother had, in his letter to
his Alicia, so delightfully anticipated. Nothing
could restrain her impatience; she burst into the
little parlour full on the astounded invalid, who
was still standing bolt upright, like a statue, in the
very position wherein we had left him. His loving
Jenny, however, unconscious that his collarbones
had been disunited, rushed into his arms
with furious affection. “Oh! my dearest Jack!”
cried she, “we <i>never</i> part <i>no</i> more! no, never—never!”
and tight, indeed, was the embrace wherewith
the happy Jenny now encircled the astonished
cornet; but, alas! down came one of the
pillows! the arm, of course, closed; and one half
of the left collar-bone being as ignorant as its
owner of the cause of so obstreperous an embrace,
and, wishing as it were to see what matter was
<span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span>going forward in the world, instantly divorced
itself from the other half, and thrusting its ivory
end through the flesh, skin, and integuments (which
had obstructed its egress), quickly appeared peeping
through the lover’s shirt.</p>

<p class='c004'>The unfortunate inamorato could stand these
accumulated shocks no longer, and sank upon the
feather-bed in a state of equal astonishment and
exhaustion, groaning pitiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here I must again apply to the imagination of
my reader for a true picture of the succeeding
scene. Fielding alone could render a detail
palatable; the surgeons were once more sent for
to reset the collar: an energetic kiss, which his
Jenny had imprinted on the cornet’s nose, again
somewhat disturbed its new position, and conferred
a pain so acute, as to excite exclamations,
by no means gentle in their nature, from the
unresisting sufferer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suffice it to say, Jenny was with much difficulty
at length forced away from her Jack, if not in a
dead <i>faint</i>, at least in something extremely <i>like</i>
one. An <i>éclaircissement</i> took place so soon as she
came round; and the <i>compromise</i>, before hinted at,
was ultimately effected.</p>

<p class='c004'>Edwards asked a hundred pardons of my poor
brother, who, worn out, and in extreme pain, declared
he would as soon die as live. In fine, it
was nearly a month more ere the cornet could travel
to Dublin, and another before he was well
<span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span>enough to throw himself at the feet of his dulcinea:
which ceremony was in due season succeeded
by the wedding<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a> I have already given
<span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span>my account of, and which left me much more unaccountably
smitten than my more fiery brother.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f49'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r49'>49</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Irish marriages ran, some few years ago, an awkward risk
of being nullified <i>en masse</i>, by the decision of two English
judges. In 1826, I met, at Boulogne-sur-Mer, a young Hibernian
nobleman, the eldest son of an Irish peer, who had arrived
there in great haste from Paris, and expressed considerable
though somewhat ludicrous trepidation on account of a rumour
that had reached him of his being <i>illegitimatised</i>. In fact, the
same dread seized upon almost all the Irish of any family there.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have no time to lose,” said Lord ——, “for the packet
is just setting off, and I must go and inquire into these matters.
By Heaven,” added he, “I won’t leave one of the judges alive,
if they take my property and title! I am fit for <i>nothing else</i>,
you <i>know</i> I am not; and I may as well be hanged as beggared!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Scarce had his lordship, from whom I could obtain no explanation,
departed, when another scion of Irish nobility, the
Honourable John Leeson, son to the late Earl of Miltown, joined
me on the pier. “Barrington, have you seen to-day’s papers?”
asked he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where was your father married?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In my grandfather’s house,” replied I, with some surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then, by Jove,” exclaimed Leeson, “you are an <i>illegitimate</i>,
and so am I!—My father was married at home, at eight
o’clock in the evening, and that’s <i>fatal</i>. A general outcry has
taken place among all the Irish at the reading-room.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He then proceeded to inform me of the real cause of the consternation—and
it was no trivial one. Two very able and
honest English judges (Bayley and Park), on trying a woman
for <i>bigamy</i>, had decided that, according to the English
law, a marriage in a private house, without special licence or in
canonical hours, was <i>void</i>; and, of course, the woman was acquitted,
having been united to her first husband in Ireland
without those requisites. Had that decision stood, it would
certainly have rendered ninety-nine out of a hundred of the
Irish Protestants, men, women, and children—nobility, clergy,
and gentry—absolutely illegitimate; it was a very droll mistake
of the learned judges, but was on the merciful side of
the question before them; was soon amended, and no mischief
whatsoever resulted from it:—though it was said that a great
number of husbands and wives were extremely <i>disappointed</i> at
the judges altering their decision. I seldom saw any couple
married in church in Ireland; and in former times the ceremony
was generally performed between dinner and supper, when people
are supposed to be vastly more in love with each other than
in the middle of the day.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Captain Tennyson Edwards subsequently ran
away with the kind-hearted Jenny, and in three
or four years after, married one of the prettiest of
my six sisters. He was one of the drollest fellows
in the world on some occasions, and had once
nearly ended his days similarly (though more vulgarly)
to the traditional catastrophe of the Duke
of Clarence in the Tower. He persuaded a very
comely dairy-maid, at Old Court, that if she
would not abscond with him, he should end his
life in despair; and she would, in the eye of
Heaven, be guilty of his <i>murder</i>: and to convince
her of his fixed determination to commit suicide
for love of her, he put his head into a very
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span>high churn of butter-milk, which was standing in
the dairy—when, the floor being slippery, his
feet gave way, and he pounced down, head-foremost
and feet upward, clean into the churn; and
had not the gardener been at hand on the instant,
he would have expired by the most novel mode
of extermination on record.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the early part of my life, the system of domestic
government and family organization was
totally different from that at present in vogue.
The patriarchal authority was then frequently
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>exercised with a rigour which, in days of degenerate
relaxation, has been converted into a fruitful
subject for even dramatic ridicule. In Ireland,
the “rule of the patriarchs” has become nearly
extinguished. New lights have shone upon the
rising generation; the “rights of women” have
become a statute law of society; and the old,
wholesome word <i>obedience</i> (by which all wives and
children were formerly influenced) has been reversed,
by prefacing it with the monosyllable <i>dis</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Every body is acquainted,” said an intimate
friend of mine to his wife, in my presence, “with
the ruinous state of obstinacy and contradiction
raging in modern times among the subordinate
members of families throughout the United Kingdom;
as if the word <i>united</i> were applied to the empire
only to satirise the <i>dis</i>united habits, manners,
politics, religion, and morality of its population.
There are,” continued he, “certain functions
that must be exercised every day (two or three
times a day <i>if possible</i>) by persons of all descriptions,
who do not wish to leave this world within a
week at the very latest; but, unless on the absolute
necessity of mastication for purposes of self-support,
I am not aware of any other subject
respecting which unanimity of opinion is even
affected among the individuals of any family
throughout the country.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The wife nodded assent, but spake not:—first,
because she hated all controversy; and second,
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span>because though, on the subject of domestic supremacy,
she was always sure of getting the worst of
the argument, she contented herself with having,
beyond doubt, the best of the practice.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r50'>50</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mrs. Mary Morton, of Ballyroan, a very worthy domestic
woman, told me, many years since, that she had but one way of
ruling her husband, which, as it is rather a novel way, and
may be of some use to my fair readers, I will mention in her

<p class='c004'>“You know,” said Mrs. Morton, “that Tom is most horribly
<i>nice</i> in his eating, and <i>fancies</i> that both abundant and good
food is <i>essential</i> to his health. Now, when he has been out of
temper with me, he is sure of having a very <i>bad</i> dinner; if he
grumbles, I tell him that whenever he puts me into a <i>twitter</i>
by his <i>tantrums</i>, I always <i>forget</i> to give the cook proper
directions. This is sure,” added she, “of keeping him in good
humour for a week at least!”</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>My friend’s observations were, I think, just. In
my time the change has been excessive; and to
enable my readers to form a better judgment of the
matter, I will lay before them a few authentic
anecdotes of rather antique dates.</p>

<p class='c004'>In volume one I mentioned the illustrious exploits
of my great-aunt, Elizabeth Fitzgerald, of
Moret Castle, and the heroic firmness wherewith
she bore the afflicting view of my great-uncle
Stephen, her husband, “dancing upon nothing”
(as the Irish phrase it) at the castle-gate, immediately
under the battlements; and though it is
<i>possible</i> there may exist some modern ladies who
might have sufficient self-possession to look on a
<span class='pageno' title='369' id='Page_369'></span>similar object without evincing those signs of inconsolability
natural to be expected on such an
occasion, yet, I will venture to say, few are to
be found who, like my aunt Elizabeth, would risk
their lives and property rather than accept of a
<i>second</i> husband. Nor do I believe that, since the
patriarchal government has been revolutionised by
the unnatural rebellion of wives and children,
there has existed one lady—young, old, or middle-aged,
in the three kingdoms, who could be persuaded
to imitate the virtuous gentoos, and voluntarily
undergo conflagration with her departed
lord and master.</p>

<p class='c004'>My great-uncle had a son born unto him by
his magnanimous spouse, who was very young,
and in the castle at the time his father was <i>corded</i>
(<i>Hibernice</i>). Elizabeth led him to the castle top,
and showing him his dangling parent, cried, “See
there! you were born a Geraldine; the blood of
that noble race is in you, my boy! See—see the
sufferings of your own father! Never did a <i>true</i>
Geraldine forgive an enemy! I perceive your
little face gets flushed:—you tremble; ay, ay, ’tis
for <i>revenge</i>! Shall a Cahill live?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, mother, no! when I’m able, I’ll kill them
<i>all</i>! I’ll kill all the Cahills myself!” cried the lad,
worked on by the fury of his respectable mother.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s my dear boy!” said Elizabeth, kissing
him fervently. “Shall <i>one</i> live?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span>“No, mother, not one,” replied the youngster.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Man, woman, or child?” pursued the heroine.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Neither man, woman, nor child,” echoed her
precocious son.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are a Geraldine,” repeated Elizabeth.
“Call the priest,” added she, turning to a warder.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He made a little too free, my lady mistress,”
said the warder, “and is not very fitting for duty,
saving your presence;—but he’ll soon sleep it
off.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bring him up, nevertheless,” cried Elizabeth:—“I
command you to bring up his reverence.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The priest was accordingly <i>produced</i> by Keeran
Karry. “Father,” said the lady, “where’s your
manual?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where should it be,” <i>answered</i> the priest
(rather sobered), “but where it always is, lady?”
pulling, as he spake, a book out of a pocket in the
waistband of his breeches, where (diminished
and under the name of a <i>fob</i>) more modern clergymen
carry their watches.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c012'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f51'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r51'>51</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The priests then, to render mass <i>handy</i>, invariably kept
their manual in their breeches with a piece of strong green ribbon
(having beads at the end of it) to lug it out by, resembling
the chain of a modern buckish parson’s timepiece. They also
gave another very extraordinary reason for keeping their manual
in their smallclothes—namely, that no <i>devil</i> would presume
to come near them when he was sure he should have the
<i>mass</i> to encounter before he could get at their carcases.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span>“Now, your reverence,” said Elizabeth, “we’ll
<i>swear</i> the young squire to revenge my poor Stephen,
his father, on the Cahills, root and branch,
so soon as he comes to manhood. Swear him!—swear
him <i>thrice</i>!” exclaimed she.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boy was duly sworn, and the manual reposited
in the priest’s smallclothes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, take the boy down and duck him, head
over heels, in the horse-pond!” cried his mother.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c012'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f52'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r52'>52</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When it was sought to make a child remember any thing
long and circumstantially, it was the custom in Ireland either to
<i>whip</i> him three or four times, <i>duck</i> him in cold water, or put
him into a bag, with his face only out, and hang it up against a
wall for a whole day. Such an extraordinary and undeserved
punishment made an impression on the fresh tablet of the
youngster’s mind never to be erased.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Young Fitzgerald roared lustily, but was nevertheless
well soused, to make him remember his
oath the better. This oath he repeated upon the
same spot, while his mother lived, on every anniversary
of his father’s murder; and it was said by
the old tenants, that “young Stephen” (though
flourishing in more civilised times) religiously
kept the vow as far as he could; and that, so soon
as he came into possession of Moret, four of the
ablest of the Cahills (by way of a beginning) were
<i>missed</i> from the neighbourhood of Timahoe in one
night—nobody ever discovering what had become
<span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span>of them; indeed, the fewest words were considered
far the safest.</p>

<p class='c004'>The skeletons of four lusty fellows, however,
were afterwards found in clearing out a pit in the
Donane colliery, and many persons said they had
belonged to the four Cahills from Timahoe; but, as
the colliers very sapiently observed, there being
no particular marks whereby to distinguish the
bones of a Cahill from those of any other “boy,”
no one could properly identify them.</p>

<p class='c004'>A bystander, who had been inspecting the relics,
protested, on hearing this remark made, that
<i>he</i> could swear to <i>one</i> of the skulls at least (which
appeared to have been fractured and trepanned);
and he gave a very good reason for this assertion—namely,
that it was himself who had “cracked
the skull of Ned Cahill, at the fair of Dysart, with
a <i>walloper</i>, and he knew the said skull ever after.
It was between jest and earnest,” continued Jemmy
Corcoran, “that I broke his head—all
about a game-cock, and be d—d to it! and by
the same token, I stood by in great grief at Maryborough,
while Doctor Stapleton was twisting a
round piece out of Ned Cahill’s skull, and laying a
<i>two-and-eight-penny-halfpenny</i><a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a> (beaten quite thin
on the smith’s forge) over the hole, to cover his
brains <i>any way</i>. The devil a brain in his sconce
<span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span>but I could see plainly; and the said <i>two-and-eight-penny-halfpenny</i>
stayed fast under his <i>wig</i> for many
a year, till Ned pulled it off (bad luck to it!) to pay
for drink with myself at Timahoe! They said
he was ever after a little cracked when in his
liquor: and I’m right sorry for having act or part
in that same fracture, for Ned was a good boy, so
he was, and nobody would strike him a stroke on
the head at any rate after the <i>two-and-eight-penny-halfpenny</i>
was <i>pledged</i> off his skull.”</p>

and Irish currency.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Though Mr. Jemmy Corcoran was so confident
as to the skull he had fractured, his testimony was
not sufficient legally to identify a Cahill, and the
four sets of bones being quietly buried at Clapook,
plenty of masses, &amp;c. were said for an entire year
by Father Cahill, of Stradbally, to get their souls
clean out of purgatory; that is, if they were in it,
which there was not a <i>clergy</i> in the place would
<i>take on</i> to say he was “sartain sure of.”<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f54'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r54'>54</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I recollect (at an interval of more than fifty years) Father
Doran, of Culmaghbeg, an excellent man, full of humour,
and well-informed, putting the <i>soul</i> in the most comprehensible
state of personification possible: he said, the <i>women</i> could not
understand what the soul was by the old explanations.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I tell you all, my flock,” said Father Doran, “there’s not
a man, woman, or child among you that has not his soul this
present minute shut up in his body, waiting for the last judgment,
according to his faith and actions. I tell you fairly, that
if flesh could be seen through, like a glass window, you might
see every one’s soul at the inside of his body peeping out
through the ribs, like the prisoners at the jail of Maryborough
through their iron bars: and the moment the breath is out of a
man or woman, the soul escapes and makes off to be dealt
with as it deserves, and that’s the truth;—so say your beads
and remember your clergy!”</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>This Stephen Fitzgerald,—who had killed the
Cahills, sure enough, as became the true son and
heir of the aforesaid Stephen, who was hanged,—lived,
as report went, plentifully and regularly at
Moret. No better gentleman existed, the old
people said, in the quiet way, after once he had
put the four Cahills into the coal-pit, as he promised
his worthy mother Elizabeth, “the likes of whom
Moret never saw before nor since, nor ever will
while time is time, and longer too!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Stephen had one son only, who is the principal
subject of my present observations; and as he and
his family (two lovely boys and two splendid girls)
were not exactly the same sort of people commonly
seen now-a-days, it may not be uninteresting
to give my readers a picture of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Stephen, the son of Elizabeth, had been persuaded
by Mr. John Lodge, an attorney of Bull
Alley, in the city of Dublin, (who married a maid-servant
of my grandfather’s at Cullenagh,) that
the two-mile race-course of the Great Heath in
Queen’s County, which King George pretended
was his property because it had been formerly
taken from a papist Geraldine, now reverted to my
great-uncle’s family, in consequence of their being
Protestants; and Mr. Lodge added, that if Squire
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span>Stephen would make his son a counsellor, no
doubt he would more aptly trace pedigrees, rights,
titles, and attainders, and, in fine, get possession
of several miles of the Great Heath, or of the race-course
at any rate.</p>

<p class='c004'>The advice was adopted, and Stephen the son was
sent to the Temple in London, to study law; and
while there, was poisoned at a cook’s shop by the
cook’s daughter because he would not marry her.
This poisoning (though it was not fatal) he always
said, <i>stopped his growth</i> like witchcraft.</p>

<p class='c004'>The father died in his bed; and my uncle,
Stephen the counsellor, became a double relative
from marrying Catherine Byrne, daughter of Sir
John Byrne, Bart., of Timahoe Castle, and sister
to my grandmother, heretofore mentioned. After
he had studied Bracton, Fleta, Littleton, the
Year Books, the three Cokes, and in short the
<i>marrow</i> of the English law, he used to say that
he got on very well with the <i>first</i> book, not so
well with the <i>second</i>, worse with the <i>third</i>; and
at length found that the more he read, the more he
was puzzled, knowing less when he left off than
when he began—as all the law books contradicted
each other like the lawyers themselves: thus, after
two years’ hard work, he gave up all further attempts
to expound, what he swore <i>fore God</i> was utterly
inexplicable. He also relinquished his father’s
squabble with King George as to the race-course
on the Great Heath; and, concentrating his search
<span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span>after knowledge upon one learned book, the “Justice
of Quorum’s pocket companion,” commenced
<i>magistrate</i>. He was likewise a horse-racer, country
gourmand, tippler, and farmer. His wife, my
aunt, was as ordinary a gentlewoman “as may be
seen of a summer’s day;” but then, she was worthy
in proportion.</p>

<p class='c004'>As to my uncle’s figure, nothing resembling it
having ever been seen, at least by me, I cannot
pretend to give any idea of it, save by an especial
description. He was short, (which he said was
the effect of the poison,) and as broad as long—appearing
to grow the wrong way. He observed,
touching this subject, that where there are <i>materials</i>
for growth, if any thing does not advance in
height, it spreads out like a <i>fir-tree</i>,<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a> when the
top shoot is broken off and it fills wide at the
bottom. He was not actually fat, nor particularly
bony: I think his bulk consisted of solid, substantial
flesh. His face was neither extravagantly
ugly, nor disproportioned to his body; but a double,
or rather treble chin descended in layers
very nearly to the pit of his stomach, whence his
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span>paunch abruptly stretched out, as if placed by
Nature as a shelf for the chin to rest upon. His
limbs each gained in thickness what it wanted in
length; so that it would seem impossible for him
to be <i>thrown down</i>, or if he were, he would roll
about like a ball. His hands (as if Nature exhibited
the contrast for amusement’s sake) were
thin, white, and lady-like; so much so, indeed,
that did he fall, they could not help him up again.
“Each particular hair” was almost of the thickness
of a goose-quill; his locks were <i>queued</i> behind,
and combed about once or twice a <i>month</i>.
His nostrils were always crammed with snuff,
(now and then discharged, as from a mortar, by
sneezing,) and his <i>chins</i> were so well dusted and
caked with that material, that the whole visage
at times appeared as if it were a magazine thereof.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f55'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r55'>55</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This idea was a standing joke with him for some time, till
old Kit Julian, the retired exciseman, (heretofore mentioned,)
made a hit at my uncle, which put his comparison to an end.
“By my troth, then, Counsellor,” said Kit, “if you <i>are</i> like
a fir, it is not a ‘<i>spruce</i> fir’ any how.” This sarcasm cut my
uncle in the <i>raw</i>; and it was said that he had an additional
shaving day, and clean cravat every week afterward.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>My uncle’s dress exactly matched his style of
person: he always wore a <i>snuff</i>-coloured coat and
breeches, with a scarlet waistcoat that had been
once bound with lace (the strings whereof remained,
like ruins in a landscape); blue worsted stockings,
and immense silver shoe and knee-buckles.
His hat was very large, with a blunt cock in front.
It had also once been fully laced; but, no <i>button</i>
had been seen on it since the year succeeding his
nuptials.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fruits of my uncle’s marriage were, as I
have said, two boys and two girls. The eldest of
these Geraldines, Tom, took to what ignorant doctors
<span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span>call <i>poison</i>—but country gentlemen, <i>potation</i>. My
uncle declared, he knew from his own experience
that a “little learning was a dangerous thing;”
and therefore thought it better that Tom should
have <i>none at all</i>! Tom therefore studied nothing
but “Carolan’s receipt for drinking!” The art
of writing his own name came pretty readily; but
his penmanship went no further. At twenty-six
he quarrelled with a vicious horse, which was
easily offended. The animal, on his master’s striking
him with a whip, returned the blow with his
hoof (a horse’s <i>fist</i>); and on Tom being taken to
his chamber and examined, it was found that he
had left the greater part of his brains in the stable.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack, his brother, was now heir-apparent. His
figure was nearly as grotesque, but only half the
size of his father’s; his eyes were of the most <i>cautious</i>
description, one closely watching his nose, the
other glancing quite <i>outward</i>, to see that no enemy
approached. He loved liquor as well as Tom, but
could not get down so much of it. Nevertheless,
after a pretty long life, he was <i>concluded</i> by rather
extravagant and too frequent doses of port and
potsheen.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have already given some account of the castle
of Moret as it formerly appeared. When I last
saw it, some dozen of years back, it presented
nothing remarkable save its ivy covering. The
dwelling-house, which as it stood in my uncle’s
time would have been worth detailing (had not
<span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span>every country gentleman’s mansion been of a
similar genus), had declined into an ordinary residence.
In Squire Stephen’s day, it was low,
long, dilapidated, dirty, old, and ugly—and had
defied paint, plaster and whitewash for at least
the better half of a century. The barn, court,
dunghill, pigeon-house, horse-pond, piggery, and
slaughter-house, formed, as usual, the chief prospects
from the parlour-windows; and on hot days
the effluvia was so exquisite (they accounted it
very <i>wholesome</i>) that one might clearly distinguish
each several perfume.</p>

<p class='c004'>My uncle never could contrive to stick on
horseback, and therefore considered riding as a
dangerous exercise for <i>any</i> gentleman. He used
to say (it was indeed one of his standing jokes)
that jockeys and vulgar persons, being themselves
<i>beasts</i>, might stick by virtue of mutual attraction
upon their own species; but that ladies and
gentlemen were, as a matter of course, always
subject to tumble off. He bred and kept, notwithstanding,
four or five race-horses, which he
got regularly trained; and at every running upon
the heath or curragh, he entered such of them as
were qualified by weight, &amp;c.: yet, singularly
enough, though the animals were well bred and
well trained, not one, during the whole of the five-and-twenty
years that he kept them, ever won a
plate, prize, or race of any description: for all
that, he would never sell either for <i>any</i> price; and
<span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span>when they got too old to run any more, they were
turned out to end their days unmolested in a
marsh and the straw-yard. It was said by those
competent to judge that some of these animals
were excellent; but that Squire Fitzgerald’s old
groom used to give <i>trials</i>, and to physic the horses;
and that (through his people) they were <i>bought off</i>
when there was a probability of their winning.
However, my uncle, so that none of them were
<i>distanced</i>, was just as well pleased, exhibiting not
the least uneasiness at their failure. Indeed, he
never attended any of the races personally, or
betted a shilling upon the event of one—circumstances
which remind me of a certain judge, who
was always sufficiently <i>gratified</i> by a simple <i>conviction</i>
and by passing <i>sentence</i> on a culprit, eventually
saving more lives by pardon than any two
of his colleagues.</p>

<p class='c004'>I was very young when taken to my uncle’s, for
a stay of some months, by my grandmother; but
at an age when strong impressions are sometimes
made upon the memory. I was a great favourite,
and indulged in every thing, even by my uncle;
and very frequently, afterward, while my aunt
lived at Moret in her widowhood, I visited there,
every visit reminding me of former times, and recalling
persons and things that might otherwise
have been lost to my juvenile recollection. This
latter was the period when, having nobody of my
own age in the house to chatter to, I took delight
<span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span>in hearing the old people about Moret tell their
long traditionary stories, which, as I observed in
my first sketch (Vol. i.) descended from generation
to generation with hereditary exactness; and, to
the present day, I retain a fondness for hearing
old occurrences detailed.</p>

<p class='c004'>My eldest female cousin, Miss Dolly Fitzgerald,
was at least twelve years older than I when I was
first taken to Moret by my grandmother; the second,
Miss Fanny, ten. Never, sure, did two sisters
present such a contrast. Dolly was as like her
father as rather more height and an uncommonly
fair skin would permit; her tongue was too large
for the mouth, and consequently thickened her
pronunciation; her hair was yellow; her feet were
like brackets, and her hands resembled milk-white
shoulders of mutton. Her features were
good; but her nostrils and upper lip displayed considerable
love of the favourite <i>comforter</i> of her
father. She was very good-natured, but ignorance
personified.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her sister was as thin as the handle of a sweeping-brush,
and had dark eyes twinkling like stars
on a vapoury evening; with yellow skin, black hair,
a mouth literally stretching across the face, (like a
foss to protect her chin,) very red lips, and much
more vivacity than comprehension. There were
few sound teeth in the whole family, and none
that a dentist would think worth the expense of
dressing.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span>For these two amiable young ladies it was the
principal object of my aunt to procure husbands,
if possible, in the neighbourhood. But the squires
were shy of matching into the family of so great
an oddity as my uncle. They preferred getting
wives among people who went on the jog-trot of
the world like themselves.</p>

<p class='c004'>On this point my uncle and aunt entirely differed;
and during the discussions as to their
differences, time ran on, nothing was done for the
ladies, and Miss Dolly was in her six-and-twentieth
year before she was fully emancipated from
the discipline of the nursery and suffered to dine
at papa’s table. When that important period
arrived, it was considered as a great epocha at
Moret Castle; all the neighbours were invited,
and Dolly’s majority was formally announced.
She was then given to understand she might
thereafter dine at the great table, speak to any
gentleman she pleased, and, in short, have full
liberty to act entirely as she thought proper, <i>provided</i>
she always <i>previously</i> consulted her father’s
will, and obeyed it without “questions asked.”
She was likewise enjoined to take especial care not
to forget her pastry.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f56'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r56'>56</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Irish ladies in the country at that period were always
taught the art of pie and dumpling making, as a necessary accomplishment;
and a husband who liked a good table always
preferred a <i>housekeeper</i> to a <i>gadder</i>. <i>Tempora mutantur!</i></p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>On these free and happy terms, Dolly was to
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span>have the chariot for a day, and to set the world
on fire. The old carriage was accordingly cleared
for action from the dust accumulated upon it; the
horses’ tails were trimmed; and the young lady
was to go to the church of Portarlington the ensuing
Sunday—“Where,” said my uncle to his
spouse, “fore gad, Kate, our Dolly will catch some
young fellow after the service is over, either in
the aisle or the churchyard. She’ll have some proposals;
but, fore gad, it’s not <i>every body</i> I’d give
her to.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t be too sure, Stephen,” rejoined my aunt.
“You keep your daughters as if they were haunches
of venison. It’s not every body who has a taste
for meat that has been hung a fortnight in the
larder to give it a flavor. The men, I tell you,
like <i>fresh and fresh</i>, Stephen; and be assured you
have kept Dolly too long to suit every man’s
palate. I have always been telling you so, but
you are perpetually saying you’ll be the <i>head</i> of
your <i>own family</i>; so now you’ll see the end of it!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, Kate, you were a good while in the
larder yourself at Timahoe before you got a husband,”
replied my uncle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I may thank the smallpox for that, Stephen,”
retorted my aunt: “only for that enemy
I should never have been mistress of Moret Castle,
Counsellor Stephen being governor of it!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you’ll see that I’m right,” said my
uncle. “I tell you, men who look out for wives
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span>like a seasoned, obedient woman at the head of
their families, and not your tittering, giddy young
creatures, that have not had time to settle their
brains or mature their understandings. No girl
should be away from the eye of her natural guardian
till she arrives at the full extent of her twenty-sixth
year, like Dolly. You’ll see now she’ll do
some <i>mischief</i> at the church or churchyard of
Portarlington!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stephen,” said my aunt, (who, by the bye,
had her nose nearly stopped by the smallpox, which
made her somewhat snuffle, and gave a peculiar <i>emphasis</i>
to her vowels,) “’tis too late! Dolly knows
nothing of the world. It would take a full year
at the church and balls at Portarlington, the races
of the Great Heath and green of Maryborough,
the hurlings at the fort of Dunrally, and a month
or two on a visit to our nephew, Jack Barrington,
at Blandsfort, before she would learn enough to be
able to converse with mankind on any subject—except
darning your stockings, or turning off a
kitchen-maid.“</p>

<p class='c004'>My uncle started as much as his form would
admit; cocked his eyebrows, and stared with all
his might. “Fore gad, Kate, I believe you are out
of your wits! Did you say Jack Barrington’s of
Blandsfort? Jack Barrington’s! Why, you know
very well, Kate, as every body knows, that there’s
nothing going on at that house but hunting and
feasting; dancing all night, and rattling about all
<span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span>day, like mad people; and coshering with raking
pots of tea, hot cakes, syllabubs, pipers, and the
devil knows what! No, no. If Dolly were to get
one month among her cousins at Blandsfort, I
should never see a day’s comfort after; topsy-turvy
would go Moret! I’d never be master of my
own house half an hour after Dolly had received a
course of instruction at Jack Barrington’s. I
don’t wish her to know too much of the world.
No, no. ’Fore Gad, Kate, Dolly never puts her
foot, while she is a spinster, into Jack Barrington’s
house at Blandsfort.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Folks generally become mulish as their years
advance, and my uncle enjoyed that quality in its
greatest perfection.—The Misses Dolly and Fanny
Fitzgerald were commanded, under the pain of displeasure,
by their patri-archal father, Stephen, to
abjure and give up all thoughts of the festivities
of Blandsfort.</p>

<p class='c004'>“’Fore Gad, Kate!” said my uncle to their
more conceding mother—“’Fore Gad, Kate, you
had better send the girls a visiting to the <i>antipodes</i>
than be turning them upside down at Blandsfort.
No rational man would have any thing to do with
them afterwards.—There it is, only pull-haul and
tear, and the devil take the hindmost!—eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And for Heaven’s sake, Stephen,” replied my
aunt, (who was no cosmographer,) “what <i>family</i>
are these <i>antipodes</i> whom you would send our
daughters to visit in preference to their nearest
<span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span>relations?—I never heard of them: they must be
upstarts, Stephen. I thought I knew every family
in the county.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“’Fore Gad, Kate!” rejoined my uncle, laughing
heartily, “your father, old Sir John, ought to
be tied to the cart’s tail for so neglecting your education.
Why, Kate, the antipodes are at this
moment standing on their heads immediately under
you—upside down, just as you see a fly on
the ceiling, without the danger of falling down
from it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And for Heaven’s sake, Stephen,” said my
puzzled aunt, “how do the ladies keep down
their petticoats in that position?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ask Sir Isaac Newton that,” said my uncle
(who was not prepared for that interrogation).
“But let me hear no more of the topsy-turvy of
their cousins at Blandsfort. I’ll send my daughters
to church at Portarlington, Kate, where they
cannot fail of being seen and much noticed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And that may not be much in their favour at
present, Stephen,” replied my aunt, who was not
blind to her progeny—“at least, until they are a
little better rigged out than in their present nursery
dresses, Stephen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rig away, rig away, Kate!” said my uncle,
“rig away; you may make them as tawdry as
jackdaws, so as you don’t turn their heads at Jack
Barrington’s.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In fine, they were made sufficiently glaring,
and, accompanied by aunt in the resuscitated post-chaise,
<span class='pageno' title='387' id='Page_387'></span>made their first <i>début</i> at the church of
Portarlington. Of course they attracted universal
notice: the ladies congratulated my aunt on her
<i>showy</i> girls; the parson on their <i>coming of age</i>;
and the innkeeper declared they were the most
genteelest of all the new subscribers to his ball
and supper at the market-house.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ladies returned to Moret highly delighted
with their cordial reception in the church-yard,
and Mrs. Gregory, the head mantua-maker of the
county, was immediately set to work to fit out the
ladies in the newest taste of Dublin fashions, preparatory
to the next ball.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, Portarlington had been a very small village
in the Queen’s County until the French Protestant
emigrants, on the revocation of the Edict
of Nantes, made a settlement there, (it was said,
from the enormous quantity of fine frogs generated
in that neighbourhood,) and there they
commenced schoolmasters and mistresses, with
a good reputation, which they ceased not to keep
up, until in time it became an established seminary.
Here the numerous schools and academies
were always ready to pour out their hobbardehoys
and misses in their teens to the dances and assemblies;
but very few mature gentlemen assisted
at these coteries, and it was the customary prayer
of all the young ladies going to those balls—“If
I cannot get a <i>man</i> for a partner, O Heaven, in
thy mercy, send me a big boy!”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span>Suffice it to say, that my cousins, at the first
ball, outglared all the females in the room put
together; my aunt’s old rings and hereditary paraphernalia
had been brought fully into requisition.
But, unfortunately, Providence sent them that
night neither a grown man partner nor a big boy
in the shape of a man partner, and, after having
sat as full-blown wall-flowers the whole night,
they returned to Moret highly discouraged, that
their rose-colour satin and family Dresdens, which
cut all the other girls out of feather, had no better
result than the going home again, my philosophical
aunt telling them all the way home—“that
balls were no places to catch husbands at, there
was so much variety; and I assure you, Dolly,”
said my aunt, “men, now-a-days, look more at a
girl’s purse than her flounces, and you’ll have nothing
very showy in that way whilst your father
and mother are alive, Dolly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>My poor cousin Dolly’s feet also, after three
balls more (dead failures) got so crimped and
cramped by tight shoes, to restrain her fat brackets
within reasonable boundaries, that corns, bunnions,
callosities, &amp;c., showed a plentiful harvest
the ensuing summer, and, conspiring with her
winter chilblains, and tortures to match, put my
poor cousin’s jigging out of the question for the
remainder of her existence.</p>

<p class='c004'>My cousin Fanny, whose feet were only bone
and gristle, made numerous exhibitions, both in
<span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span>the minuet and rigadoon, and for the same purpose;
but no wooers for the Miss Fitzgeralds of
Moret Castle made their advances; not a sigh was
exploded for either of the demoiselles, though the
church, the balls, the races at the great heath,
and hurlings at the fort of Dunnally, were all assiduously
attended for the laudable purpose aforesaid;
all in vain; and after a two years’ vigorous
chase, the game was entirely given over, and my
cousins slunk back into cover, where, in all human
probability, they would have remained during
their lives, had not Heaven sent down a putrid
fever to bring my uncle Stephen up to it, as all
the old ladies asserted (to please the widow),
although old Julian, the exciseman, ungratefully
remarked, that “there must have been a great
number of vacancies in heaven, when they called
up the counsellor there.” However, before her
weeds got rusty, my aunt, shaking a loose leg,
after having been forty years handcuffed and linked
to Counsellor Stephen, set out with the entire
family for the great city of Dublin, where, no
doubt, the merits, if not the beauty of my cousins,
with a more proximate reversion, would be duly
appreciated.</p>

<p class='c004'>However, neither their merit nor beauty, nor
the reversion, could exorcise the spirit of celibacy,
which still pursued them from Moret. Jack,
their brother, married a mantua-maker; and my
poor uncle not being a Mahomedan, and, of
<span class='pageno' title='390' id='Page_390'></span>course, not having any houri in the clouds to solace
his leisure hours, and finding himself lonesome
without his old Kate, Providence again showed
its kindness towards him, and sent down a pulmonary
consumption to Dublin, to carry my aunt
up to her well-beloved Stephen. My unfortunate
cousins were now left orphans, of only forty and
forty-one years of age, to buffet with the cares of
the world, and accept the brevet rank of old
maidens, which they certainly did, with as much
good-humour and as little chagrin as are generally
exhibited on those occasions. Their incomes were
ample for all their purposes, and they got on to
the end of their career very comfortably. Dolly
chose three lap-dogs and a parrot for her favourites,
and Fanny adopted a squirrel and four
Tom-cats to chase away her ennui. But those
animals having a natural antipathy to each other,
got into an eternal state of altercation and hostility,
the parrot eternally screeching, to make peace between
them. So a maid-servant, who understood
the humour of poodles, cats, &amp;c. &amp;c., was hired
to superintend and keep them in peace and
proper order.</p>

<p class='c004'>This maid of natural history got great ascendancy;
and, as she was what is termed in Ireland
a swaddler, (in England a canter or psalm-singer,)
she soon convinced my cousins that there was
no certain road to salvation, save through the
preachers and love-feasts of those societies. Of
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span>course a plate was laid ready for some lank
pulpiteer at dinner, every day, and my cousins
became thorough-paced swaddlers (singing excepted).
But, as years would still roll on, and
they could not be always swaddling, and saving
their souls, some extra comfort was, as customary,
found necessary for their languid hours. The
maid of natural history therefore suggested that,
as solid food and weak Bourdeaux were not of the
best efficacy for feeble appetites, which her mistresses
were beginning to show symptoms of, a
glass of cordial, now and then, in the morning,
might restore the tone of their stomachs. Of consequence,
a couple of liqueur bottles were prepared,
and always properly replenished; the ladies
found their liquid appetites daily increase: the
preacher got the whole bottle of wine to himself;
Lundy Foot’s most pungent was well crammed
into my cousins’ nostrils, as an interlude, till
snuffling was effected; and the matter went on
as cheerily as possible between the dogs and
cats, the preacher, snuff, and the cordial comforts,
till an ill-natured dropsy, with tappings to
match, sent my cousin Dolly to my uncle Stephen;
and some other disorder having transmitted cousin
Fanny the same journey to her mother, I anticipated
very great satisfaction in opening the last will
and testament of the survivor; whereupon, all things
being regularly prepared, with an audible voice
I read the first legacy, bequeathing “her body to
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span>the dust, and her soul to God,” in most pious and
pathetic expressions, and of considerable longitude.
The second legacy ran: “Item—to my
dear cousin, Jonah Barrington, I bequeathe my
mother’s wedding-ring and my father’s gold
sleeve-buttons, as family keepsakes; also all my
father’s books and papers of every description,
except bonds, or any securities for money, or contracts;”
and so far looked favourable, till, casting
my eye over the third legacy, to the wonder of
the company, I stopped short, and handing it
cautiously to the swaddling preacher (who was
present), begged he would be so kind as to read
it himself. This office he coyly accepted, and performed
it in a drawling whine, and with heavy sighs,
that made every body laugh, except myself. In
fine, cousin Fanny, after her “soul to God, and her
body to the dust,” (the latter of which legacies she
could not possibly avoid,) as to all her worldly
substance, &amp;c., bequeathed it “to such <i>charitable</i>
purposes as her maid Mary might think
proper, by and with the spiritual advice and assistance
of that holy man, Mr. Clarke.” This
pious philosopher never changed a muscle at his
good fortune. The will, indeed, could be no surprise
either to him or Mrs. Mary. With the aid
of the orator’s brother, who was an attorney, (and
got snacks,) they had prepared it according to
their own satisfaction; and cousin Fanny executed
it one evening, after her cordial and prayers
<span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span>had their full operation; and, in a few days more,
her disorder put a conclusive termination to any
possibility of revoking it.</p>

<p class='c004'>This affair had its sequel exactly as any rational
person might have anticipated. The preacher and
Mrs. Mary, after a decent mourning, united their
spiritual and temporal concerns, and became
flesh of the flesh and bone of the bone; in
which happy state of husband and wife (which
happy state they had been in many months before
the <i>ceremony</i> was thought necessary) they remained
nearly two years, when His Reverence,
happening to light on a younger and handsomer
swaddler, and legatee, after beating Mrs. Mary
almost to a jelly, embarked with his new proselyte
for America, where, changing his name, curling
his hair, colouring his eyebrows, &amp;c. &amp;c., he
turned quaker, and is at this moment, I have
learned, in good repute at meeting, and solvency
as a trader, in the city of Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c004'>The entire of my uncle Stephen’s library and
manuscripts, with the exception of the year
books, Newcastle on the Manége, seven farriery
and several cookery books, I gave to my
friend, old Lundyfoot, to envelope his powder in;
and most of my books being well impregnated,
or rather populously inhabited by divers minute
and nearly impalpable maggots, probably added
some poignancy to the sneezing qualities of his
celebrated preparation.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span>I recollect a whimsical expression used by
Davy Lander, an Irish counsellor, whom I brought
with me to hear the will read.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By my soul, Barrington,” said Lander, “she
was right enough in bequeathing her soul to
God, out of hand, or the devil would certainly
have taken it as <i>heir-at-law</i>! But I hope he has
the reversion.”</p>

<p class='c004'>That branch of the Geraldines is now entirely
extinct, having ended with my cousin Fanny,
the swaddler; and nothing now remains but the
old castle, its celebrated ivy tree, St. Bridget’s
stone, and my legends, to preserve even the recollection
of Moret.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>HANGING AN ATTORNEY BY ACCIDENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The attorney’s corps of yeomanry, and their strange appellation—Eccentric loyalty in Dublin—The Fogies—Sir John Ferns, and his anti-rebel resolve—Aide-de-Camp Potterton and the other members of Sir John’s chivalrous party—Tragi-comic incidents attending their martial progress—Admixture of discretion with bravery—Discovery of a suspicious lurker, and zealous anxiety for his immediate execution—Process of suspension—Attorney Walker’s accidental participation in the captive’s lot—Respective demeanor of the two sufferers—Appearance of the enemy in sight—The attorney relieved from his situation—Conclusion of the day’s adventures.</p>

<p class='c006'>A hanging match of a very curious nature occurred
a few days after the breaking out of the
same rebellion in Dublin, and its relation will
form an excellent companion to that of Lieutenant
H——’s mode of execution (<i>ante</i>).</p>

<p class='c004'>The attorneys’ corps of yeomanry, horse and
foot, were at that period little less than 800 or
900 strong; and I really believe it might, in an
enemy’s country, (or even in a remote district of
its own,) have passed for as fine a “pulk of Cossacks”
as ever came from the banks of the Don
or the Danube.</p>

<p class='c004'>In Ireland, every thing has its <i>alias</i> denomination;—in
<span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span>the regular army, certain regiments
are honoured by the titles of the “King’s <i>own</i>,” the
“Queen’s <i>own</i>,” or the “Prince’s <i>own</i>,” &amp; c. Many
of the Irish yeomanry corps, in 1798, were indulged
with similar distinctions; not indeed by the King
himself, but by his majesty’s sovereign mob of
Dublin. For example, the attorneys’ regiment
was christened, collectively, the “<i>Devil’s</i> own;”
the infantry part of it, the <i>Rifle</i> Brigade;
and the cavalry, the <i>Chargers</i>; the Custom-house
corps, Cæsar’s (<i>seizer’s</i>) army, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
The pre-eminent titles thus given to the attorneys,
(who are gentlemen by <i>Act of Parliament</i>,)
were devised by one Mr. Murry, a cheese and
oilman in Great George Street, whose premises
(as he deposed) were stormed one night by a
patrol of that legal corps, and divers articles of
the first quality-food and luxury, cheeses, hams,
tongues, anchovies, Burton ale, and bottled porter,
&amp;c. were abstracted against his will therefrom, and
feloniously conveyed into, and concealed in, the
bodies, bowels, and intestines, of divers ravenous
and thirsty attorneys, solicitors, and scriveners;
and thereby conveyed beyond the reach or jurisdiction
of any search warrants, replevins, or
other legal process. A more curious deposition
did not appear during the whole of those troublesome
times, than that sworn by Mr. Murry,
cheese and oilman, and annexed to a petition
to parliament for <i>compensation</i>. However, the
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span>parliament, not considering Mr. Murry to be an
extra-loyalist (but which the attorneys certainly
were, and <i>ultra</i> into the bargain), refused to
replenish his warehouse. In consequence whereof,
Mr. Murry decided upon his own revenge by
nicknaming the <i>enemy</i>, wherein he succeeded
admirably.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here I cannot avoid a little digression, by
observing, that so strong and enthusiastic was
the genuine loyalty which seized upon the
nobility, gentry, and clergy of Dublin at that
period, that even the young gentlemen of Merrion
Square, who had so far advanced toward their
grand climacteric as to exceed threescore, formed
a strong band of volunteers, who proved their
entire devotion to king and country, by first
parading every fine evening, then drinking tea and
playing whist, and afterwards patrolling all Merrion
Square—east, west, north, and south; and if
there had been any more sides, no doubt they
would have patrolled them also. They then, in a
most loyal manner, supped alternately at each
other’s houses. They were commanded by Lord
Viscount Allen, who was surnamed the “<i>Bog of
Allen</i>,” from his size and substance, and contrasted
with the Lieutenant-Colonel, Mr. Westenra,
(father of the present Lord Rossmore,) who,
having no flesh of his own, was denominated “the
Commissary.” This company, as a body, were
self-intitled the <i>Garde du Corps</i>, alluding to their
<span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span>commander Lord Allen; and as they could have
(by the course of nature) but a short period either
to fight or run away, and life, like every other commodity,
when it runs rather short, becomes the
more valuable, so they very wisely took most especial
care of the remnants of their own, as <i>civilians</i>:
and, of a wet or damp night, I have with great pleasure
seen a score, at least, of our venerable <i>Garde
Grenadier</i> gallantly patrolling Merrion Square,
and marching in a long file of sedan-chairs, with
their muskets sticking out of the windows ready
to deploy and fire upon any rebel enemy to church
or state, who should dare to oppose their progress
and manœuvres.</p>

<p class='c004'>The humorists of that day, however, would not
consent to any <i>Gallic</i> denomination for these loyal
yeomen, whom they rather chose to distinguish
by a real Irish title; viz. the <i>Fogies</i>,<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a>—a term
meaning, in Hibernian dialect, “a bottle that has
<span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span>no liquor in it.” This excellent corps, in due
time, however, died off without the aid of any
enemy, and, I fear, not one of them remains to
celebrate the loyalty of the defunct. I therefore
have taken upon myself that task, (so far as my
book can accomplish it,) for which I shall, doubtless,
receive the heartfelt thanks of their sons and
grandchildren.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f57'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r57'>57</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Few gentlemen in Ireland made more “<i>Fogies</i>” than the
good and witty Sir Hercules Langrish, one of that corps, and
who was said to have been the godfather of his company.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir Hec’s idea of “<i>Fogies</i>” may be collected from an anecdote
Sir John Parnell, chancellor of the exchequer, used to
tell of him with infinite pleasantry.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir John, one evening immediately after dinner, went to Sir
Hercules on some official business: he found him in the midst
of revenue papers, with two empty bottles and a glass standing
immediately before him. “What the deuce, Sir Hec!” said
Sir John, “why, have you finished these two already?”—“To
be sure I have,” said Sir Hec; “they were only claret.”—“And
was nobody helping you?” said Sir John. “Oh, yes,
yes!” said Sir Hercules; “see there, a bottle of port came to
my assistance; there’s his <i>fogy</i>.”</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>I shall now proceed to the misfortunes of an
attorney, neither deserved nor expected by that
loyal yeoman: the anecdote, however, should remain
as a caution and warning to all hangmen
by profession, and other loyal executioners, down
to the latest posterity.</p>

<p class='c004'>The regiment of attorneys, &amp;c. (or, as the
malicious Mr. Murry called them, the “Devil’s
own”) was at that time extremely well commanded;
the cavalry (or “chargers”) by a very
excellent old fox-hunting solicitor, Arthur Dunn;
the infantry, (or rifle companies,) by Mr. Kit
Abbot, a very good, jovial, popular practitioner.</p>

<p class='c004'>Both commanders were loyal to the back-bone;
they formed unbending buttresses of church and
state, and had taken the proper obligation, “to
bury themselves under the ruins of the Weavers’
Hall and Skinners’ Alley, sooner than yield one
inch of the <i>Dodder River</i> or the <i>Poddle Gutters</i> to
any <i>Croppy</i> or democratic papist.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span>After the rebellion broke out, some of these
true and loyal attorneys, feeling that martial law
had totally superseded their own,—and that,
having nothing to do in the <i>money</i>-market,
their visits to the <i>flesh</i>-market were proportionably
curtailed; credit having likewise got totally
out of fashion, (as usual during rebellions,)—they
bethought themselves of accomplishing some
military achievement which might raise their renown,
and perhaps at the same time “raise the
wind;” and, as good luck would have it, an opportunity
soon turned up, not only of their signalising
their loyalty, but also (as they imagined without
much hazard) of a <i>couple of days’ feasting</i> at free
quarters.</p>

<p class='c004'>This adventure eventually had the fortunate
result of procuring a bulletin in several of the
Dublin newspapers, though it did not seriously
give the gallant yeomen half the credit which their
intrepidity and sufferings had merited.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir John Ferns,<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a> who had been sheriff, and the
<span class='pageno' title='401' id='Page_401'></span>most celebrated wine-merchant of Dublin, was at
that period justly admired for his singing—his
luxurious feasts—insatiable thirst—and hard-going
hospitality: his amarynth nose, with cheeks of
Bardolph, twinkling black eyes with a tinge of
blood in the white of them, rendered any further
sign for his wine-vaults totally unnecessary.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f58'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r58'>58</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sir J. Ferns had one quality to an astonishing extent, which
I can well vouch for, having often heard and seen its extraordinary
effects.</p>

<p class='c004'>His singing voice, I believe, never yet was equalled for its
depth and volume of sound. It exceeded all my conceptions,
and at times nearly burst the tympanum of the ear, without the
slightest discord!</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet his falsetto, or feigned voice, stole in upon the bass without
any tones of that abrupt transition which is frequently perceptible
amongst the best of songsters: his changes, though as
it were from thunder to a flute, had not one disagreeable tone
with them.</p>

<p class='c004'>This extreme depth of voice was only in perfection when he
was in one of his singing humours; and the effect of it (often
shivering empty glass) was of course diminished in a large,
and altogether inoperative in a very spacious room; but, in a
moderately low and not very large chamber, its effect was
miraculous.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>This Sir John (like the Earl of Northumberland
in Cheviot Chase) had made some vow, or cursed
some curse, that he would take his sport three
summer days, hanging or hunting rebels, and
burning their haunts and houses about the town
of Rathfarnan, where he had a villa. All this he
was then empowered and enabled to do, by virtue
of martial law, without pain or penalty, or lying
under any compliment to judges or juries, as in
more formal or legal epochas. He accordingly set
about recruiting well-disposed and brave associates
to join him in the expedition, and most fortunately
hit upon Attorney James Potterton, Esq.,
in every point calculated for his aide-de-camp.
The troop was quickly completed, and twenty
<span class='pageno' title='402' id='Page_402'></span>able and vehement warriors, with Captain Sir
John Ferns at their head, and Mr. James Potterton,
(who was appointed sergeant,) set out to hang,
hunt, and burn all before them where they found
disloyalty lurking about Rathfarnan.</p>

<p class='c004'>The troop was composed of five attorneys; three
of Mr. John Claudius Beresford’s most expert
yeomen, called <i>manglers</i>, from his riding-house;
two grocers from the guild of merchants; an exciseman,
and a master tailor; a famous slop-seller
from Poolbeg-street; a buck parson from the county
of Kildare; one of Sir John’s own bottlers, and his
principal corker; also a couple of sheriff’s officers.
Previously to setting out, the captain filled their
stomachs gullet-high with ham, cold round, and
cherry bounce; and being so duly filled, Sir John
then told them the order of battle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I sent to the landlord of the yellow house of
Rathfarnan, many months ago,” said Sir John,
“a hogshead of my capital <i>chateau margot</i>, for
which he has never paid me; and as that landlord
now, in all probability, deserves to be hanged, we
can at least put up with him at nights; drink
my <i>chateau;</i> do military execution in the days,
which will report well to Lord Castlereagh; and
at all events, the riding and good cheer can do
us no harm.” This was universally approved of;
and, led by this gallant and celebrated vintner,
the troop set off to acquire food and fame about
the environs of the capital.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='403' id='Page_403'></span>Sergeant Potterton, who was a very good-humoured
and good-natured attorney, with a portion
of slang dryness and a sly drawl, diverting
enough, afterwards recited to me the whole of their
adventure, which campaign was cut a good deal
shorter than the warriors premeditated.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No man,” said Attorney Potterton, “could be
better calculated to lead us to any burning excursion
than Sir John. You know, Counsellor, that
every feature in his face is the picture of a conflagration;
and the people swear that when he
bathes, the sea <i>fizzes</i>, as if he was a hot iron.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But,” continued Sergeant Potterton, “Counsellor
Curran’s story of Sir John’s nose setting a
cartridge on fire, when he was for biting off the
end of it, has not one word of truth in it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This troop had advanced on their intended route
just to the spot where, a few nights before, the
Earl of Roden had received a bullet in his nightcap,
and had slain some rebels, when Sergeant Potterton
espied a rebel skulking in what is called
in Ireland a brake or knock of furze. Of course
the sergeant immediately shouted out, in the proper
military style—“Halloa, boys!—halloa!—hush!—hush!—silence!—halloa!
Oh! by ——,
there’s a nest of rapparee rebels in that knock.
Come on, lads, and we’ll slice every mother’s
babe of them to their entire satisfaction. Now,
draw, boys!—draw!—cock!—charge!” said the
grocers. “Charge away!” echoed the attorneys;
<span class='pageno' title='404' id='Page_404'></span>and without further ceremony they did charge the
knock of furze with most distinguished bravery:
but, alas! their loyal intentions were disappointed;
the knock of furze was found uninhabited; the
rebels had stolen off, on their hands and feet, across
a ditch adjoining it; and whilst the royal scouters
were busily employed cutting, hacking, and twisting
every furze and tuft, in expectation that a rebel
was behind it, of a sudden a certain noise and
smoke, which they had no occasion for, came
plump from an adjoining ditch. “Halloa!—halloa!—I’m
hit, by ——!” said one. “I’m grazed,
by the ——!” said another. “I heard the slugs
whiz like hailstones by my head!” swore a third.
“O, blood and ——z!” roared out Sergeant Potterton
the attorney, “I’ve got an <i>indenture</i> in my
forehead.”—“This is nothing else but a fair ambush,”
said Malony the bailiff, scratching his cheek,
through which a couple of slugs had made an illegal
entry to visit his grinders. “Church and state
be d——d!” said the buck parson, <i>inadvertently</i>,
on seeing a dash of blood on his waistcoat. “Oh,
murder! murder!” cried the slop-merchant. “Oh,
Mary Ann, Mary Ann! why did I not stay fair
and easy at Poolbeg-street, as you wanted me,
and I would not be massacred in this manner?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Many of the combatants actually fancied themselves
mortally wounded, at least, and all flocked
round Captain Sir John Ferns for orders in this
emergency. “Halloa!” roared the captain;
<span class='pageno' title='405' id='Page_405'></span>“Halloa, boys, wheel—wheel—eel—l—boys! I
say, wheel—l—l!” But being too brave to specify
whether to the right, or left, or front, or rear,
every wheeler wheeled according to his own taste
and judgment; some to right and others to left,
by twos, threes, fours, and single files, as was
most convenient; of course the poor horses, being
equally uncertain as the riders, absolutely charged
each other in one <i>mélange</i>—heads and tails—helter
skelter—higgledy piggledy—rumps and foreheads
all toulting and twisting, to the great edification of
the gentlemen rebels, who stood well hid behind
the ditch, charging for another volley.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir John standing bravely in the centre to rally
his men, his nose like the focus of a burning-glass
collecting its rays, was himself a little astounded
at seeing the number who appeared wounded and
bleeding after so short an encounter. For this
surprise the captain no doubt had very good
cause: his charger had, in truth, got a bullet
through his nostrils, and not being accustomed to
twitches of that kind, he began to toss up his
head, very naturally, in all directions, dispersing
his blood on the surrounding warriors; whilst, there
being no particular tint by which the blood of a
Christian or an attorney and that of a horse are
distinguished on a field of battle, every gallant
who got a splash of the gelding’s <i>aqua vitæ</i> from
his nose and nostrils, fancied it was his own
precious gore which was gushing out of some hole
<span class='pageno' title='406' id='Page_406'></span>bored into himself, in defence of the church and
state; to both of which articles he gave a smothered
curse for bringing him into so perilous and
sanguinary an adventure.</p>

<p class='c004'>However, they wisely considered that the greatest
bravery may be carried too far, and become
indiscretion. By a sort of instinctive coincidence
of military judgment, therefore, without waiting
for a council of war, word of command, or such
ill-timed formalities, the whole troop immediately
proved in what a contemptible point of view they
held such dangers; and to show that they could
turn a battle into a matter of amusement, commonly
called a horse-race—such as was practised
by the carbineers at the battle of Castlebar (<i>ante</i>),
Captain Ferns, Sergeant Potterton, and the entire
troop, started from the post, or rather the knock
of furze, at the same moment, every jockey trying
whose beast could reach a quarter of a mile off
with the greatest expedition. This was performed
in a time incredibly short. The winner,
however, never was decided; as, when a halt
took place, every jockey swore that he was the
last—being directly contrary to all horse-races
which do not succeed a <i>battle</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the race was over, a council of war ensued,
and they unanimously agreed, that as no
rebel had actually appeared, they must of course
be defeated, and that driving rebels out of the
furze was, in matter of fact, a victory.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='407' id='Page_407'></span>After three cheers, therefore, for the Protestant
ascendancy, they determined to follow up their
success, and scour the neighbourhood of all lurking
traitors.</p>

<p class='c004'>With this object (like hounds that had lost their
game), they made a cast to get upon the scent
again; so at a full hand-gallop they set out, and
were fortunate enough to succeed in the enterprise.
In charging through a corn-field, the slop-seller’s
horse, being rather near-sighted, came head
foremost over some bulky matter hid amongst the
corn.—“Ambush!—ambush!” cried Sir John:—“Ambush!
ambush!” echoed his merry men all.
Sergeant Potterton, however, being more fool-hardy
than his comrades, spurred on to aid the
poor slop-trader: in getting across the deep furrows,
his gelding took the same summersets as
his less mettlesome companion, and seated Sergeant
Potterton exactly on the carcass of the slop-man,
who, for fear of worse, had laid himself very
quietly at full length in the furrow; and the sergeant,
in rising to regain his saddle, perceived
that the slop-man’s charger had stumbled over
something which was snoring as loud as a couple
of French-horns close beside him. The sergeant
promptly perceived that he had gotten a real prize:
it was, with good reason, supposed to be a drunken
rebel, who lay dozing and snorting in the furrow,
but, certainly, not dreaming of the uncomfortable
journey he was in a few minutes to travel into
<span class='pageno' title='408' id='Page_408'></span>a world that, before he fell asleep, he had not
the least idea of visiting.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hollo! hollo! hollo! Captain, and brave boys,”
cried Attorney Potterton: “I’ve got a lad sure
enough; and though he has no arms about him,
there can be no doubt but they lie hid in the corn:
so his guilt is proved; and I never saw a fellow
a more proper example to make in the neighbourhood!”
In this idea all coincided. But what was
to be done to legalize his death and burial, was a
query. A drum-head court-martial was very
properly mentioned by the captain; but on considering
that they had no drum to try him on,
they were at a considerable puzzle, till Mr. Malony
declared “that he had seen a couple of
gentlemen hanged in Dublin on Bloody-bridge a
few days before, without any trial, and that by
martial law no trial was then necessary for hanging
of any body.” This suggestion was unanimously
agreed to, and the rebel was ordered to be immediately
executed on an old leafless tree, (which
was at the corner of the field, just at their possession,)
called in Ireland a rampike.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was, however, thought but a proper courtesy
to learn from the malefactor himself <i>whom</i> they
were to hang. He protested an innocence, that
no loyal man in those times could give any
credit to; he declared that he was Dan Delany,
a well-known brogue-maker at Glan Malour; that
he was going to Dublin for leather; but the whisky
<span class='pageno' title='409' id='Page_409'></span>was too many for him, and he lay down to sleep
it off when their hands waked him. “Nonsense!”
said the whole troop, “he’ll make a most beneficial
example!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nothing now was wanting but a rope, a couple
of which the bailiff had fortunately put into his
coat-case for a magistrate near Rathfarnan, as
there were no ropes there the strength of which
could be depended upon, if rebels happened to
be fat and weighty, or hanged in couples.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was most fortunate; and all parties lent
a hand at preparing the cravat for Mr. Dan Delany,
brogue-maker. Mr. Walker happened to
be the most active in setting the throttler, so as
to ensure no failure. All was arranged; the rebel
was slung cleverly over the rampike; but Mr.
Walker, perceiving that the noose did not run
glib enough, rode up to settle it about the neck
so as to put Mr. Delany out of pain, when, most
unfortunately, his own fist slipped inadvertently
into the noose, and, whilst endeavouring to extricate
himself, his charger got a smart kick with the
rowels, which, like all other horses, considering as
an order to proceed, he very expertly slipped from
under Attorney Walker, who was fast, and left him
dangling in company with his friend the brogue-maker,
one by the head, and the other by the
fist; and as the rope was of the best manufacture,
it kept both fast and clear from the ground, swinging
away with some grace and the utmost security.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='410' id='Page_410'></span>The beast being thus freed from all constraint,
thought the best thing he could do was to gallop
home to his own stable (if he could find the way
to it), and so set out with the utmost expedition,
kicking up behind, and making divers vulgar
noises, as if he was ridiculing his master’s misfortune.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was, however, stopped on the road, and sent
home to Dublin, with an intimation that Captain
Ferns and all the troop were cut off near Rathfarnan;
and this melancholy intelligence was published,
with further particulars, in a second edition
of the Dublin Evening Post, two hours after the
arrival of Mr. Walker’s charger in the metropolis.</p>

<p class='c004'>Misfortunes never come alone. The residue of
the troop in high spirits had cantered on a little.
The kind offices of Mr. Walker to Mr. Delany
being quite voluntary, <i>they</i> had not noticed
his humanity; and, on his roaring out to the very
extent of his lungs, and the troop turning round,
as the devil would have it, another tree intercepted
the view of Mr. Walker, so that they
perceived a very different object.—“Captain,
Captain,” cried out four or five of the troop, all
at once, “Look there! look there!” and there did
actually appear several hundred men, attended
by a crowd of women and children, approaching
them by the road on which the rebel had been
apprehended. There was no time to be lost; and
a second heat of the horse-race immediately took
<span class='pageno' title='411' id='Page_411'></span>place, but without waiting to be started, as on the
former occasion; and this course being rather
longer than the last, led them totally out of sight
of Messrs. Walker and Delany.</p>

<p class='c004'>The attorney and rebel had in the mean time
enjoyed an abundance of that swing-swang exercise
which so many professors of law, physic, and
divinity practised pending the Irish insurrection;
nor was there the slightest danger of their pastime
being speedily interrupted, as Captain Ferns’
troop, being flanked by above three hundred rebels,
considered that the odds were too tremendous to
hold out any hopes of a victory: of course a
retrograde movement was considered imperative,
and they were necessitated, as often happens after
boasted victories, to leave Messrs. Walker and
Delany twirling about in the string, like a pair of
fowls under a bottle-jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>But notwithstanding they were both in close
and almost inseparable contact, they seemed to
enjoy their respective situations with a very different
demeanour.</p>

<p class='c004'>The unpleasant sensations of Mr. Delany had
for a considerable time subsided into a general
tranquillity, nor did his manner in the slightest
degree indicate any impatience or displeasure at
being so long detained in company with the inveterate
solicitor; nor indeed did he articulate one
sentence of complaint against the boisterous conduct
of his outrageous comrade.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='412' id='Page_412'></span>The attorney, on the contrary, not being blessed
with so even a temper as Mr. Delany, showed
every symptom of inordinate impatience to get out
of his company, and exhibited divers samples of
plunging, kicking, and muscular convulsion, more
novel and entertaining than even those of the most
celebrated rope-dancers; he also incessantly vociferated
as loud, if not louder than he had ever
done upon any former occasion, though not in any
particular dialect or language, but as a person
generally does when undergoing a cruel surgical
operation.</p>

<p class='c004'>The attorney’s eyes not having any thing to do
with the hanging matter, he clearly saw the
same crowd approaching which had caused the
retrograde movement of his comrades; and, as it
approached, he gave himself entirely up for lost,
being placed in the very same convenient position
for piking as Absalom (King David’s natural
son) when General Joab ran him through the
body without the slightest resistance; and though
the attorney’s toes were not two feet from the
ground, he made as much fuss, floundering and
bellowing, as if they had been twenty.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man of law at length became totally exhausted
and tranquil, as children generally are
when they have no strength to squall any longer.
He had, however, in this state of captivity, the
consolation of beholding (at every up glance) the
bloated, raven-gray visage of the king’s enemy,
<span class='pageno' title='413' id='Page_413'></span>and his disloyal eyes bursting from their sockets,
and full glaring with inanimate revenge on the
loyalist who had darkened them. A thrilling
horror seized upon the nerves and muscles of the
attorney: his sins and clients were now (like the
visions in Macbeth, or King Saul and the Witch
of Endor) beginning to pass in shadowy review
before his imagination. The last glance he could
distinctly take, as he looked upward to Heaven
for aid, (there being none at Rathfarnan,)
gave a dismal glimpse of his once red-and-white
engrossing member, now, like the chameleon, assuming
the deep purple hue of the rebel jaw it
was in contact with, the fingers spread out,
cramped, and extended as a fan before the rebel
visage; and numbness, the avant-courier of mortification,
having superseded torture, he gave himself
totally up to Heaven. If he had a hundred
prayers, he would have repeated every one of
them; but, alas! theology was not his forte, and
he was gradually sinking into that merciful insensibility
invented by farriers, when they twist an
instrument upon a horse’s nostrils, that the torture
of his nose may render him insensible to the pains
his tail is enduring.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the mean time the royal troop, which had
most prudentially retreated to avoid an overwhelming
force, particularly on their flank, as the
enemy approached, yielded ground, though gradually.
The enemy being all foot, the troop kept only
<span class='pageno' title='414' id='Page_414'></span>a quarter of a mile from them, and merely retreated
a hundred yards at a time, being sure of
superior speed to that of the rebels,—when, to
the surprise of Captain Ferns, the enemy made
a sudden wheel, and took possession of a churchyard
upon a small eminence, as if intending
to pour down on the cavalry, if they could
entice them within distance; but, to the astonishment
of the royal troopers, instead of the Irish
war-whoop, which they expected, the enemy set
up singing and crying in a most plaintive and inoffensive
manner. The buck parson, with Malony
the bailiff, being ordered to reconnoitre, immediately
galloped back, announcing that the enemy
had a coffin, and were performing a funeral; but,
both swearing that it was a new ambush, and the
whole troop coinciding in the same opinion, a
further retreat was decided on, which might be
now performed without the slightest confusion.
It was also determined to carry off their dead, for
such it was taken for granted the attorney must
have been, by the excess of his agitation, dancing
and plunging till they lost sight of him, and also
through the contagion and poisonous collision of
a struggling rebel, to whom he had been so long
cemented.</p>

<p class='c004'>In order, therefore, to bring off the solicitor,
dead or alive, they rallied, formed, and charged,
sword in hand, towards the rampike, where
they had left Attorney W—— and Mr. Delany in
<span class='pageno' title='415' id='Page_415'></span>so novel a situation, and where they expected no
loving reception.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the mean time, it turned out that the kicking,
plunging, and rope-dancing of the attorney had
their advantages; as, at length, the obdurate rope,
by the repeated pulls and twists, slipped over
the knot of the rampike which had arrested its
progress, ran freely, and down came the rebel
and royalist together, with an appropriate crash,
on the green sod under their gibbet, which seemed
beneficently placed there by nature on purpose to
receive them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The attorney’s innocent feet, however, still
remained tightly moored to the gullet of the
guilty rebel, and might have remained there till
they grew or rotted together, had not the opportune
arrival of his gallant comrades saved them
from mortification.</p>

<p class='c004'>To effect the separation of Attorney W——
and Mr. Delany was no easy achievement: the
latter had gone to his forefathers, but the rope was
strong and tight, both able and willing to have
hung half a dozen more of them, if employed to
do so. Many loyal pen-knives were set instantly
at work; but the rope defied them all; the knot
was too solid. At length Sergeant Potterton’s
broad-sword, having assumed the occupation of a
saw, effected the operation without any accident,
save sawing across one of the attorney’s veins.
The free egress of his loyal gore soon brought its
<span class='pageno' title='416' id='Page_416'></span>proprietor to his sense of existence; though three
of the fingers had got so clever a stretching, that
the muscles positively refused to bend any more
for them, and they ever after retained the same
fan-like expansion as when knotted to Mr.
Delany. The index and thumb still retained
their engrossing powers, to the entire satisfaction
of the club of Skinners’ Alley, of which he was an
active alderman.</p>

<p class='c004'>The maimed attorney was now thrown across a
horse and carried to a jingle,<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c012'><sup>[59]</sup></a> and sent home with
all the honours of war to his wife and children,
to make what use they pleased of.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f59'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r59'>59</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A jingle is a species of jaunting-car used in the environs of
Dublin by gentry that have no other mode of travelling.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Captain Ferns’ royal troop now held another
council of war, to determine on ulterior operations;
and, though the rebel army in the church-yard
might have been only a funeral, it was unanimously
agreed that an important check had been
given to the rebels of Rathfarnan; yet that prudence
was as necessary an ingredient in the art
of war as intrepidity; and that it might be risking
the advantage of what had been done, if they made
any attempt on the yellow house, or the captain’s
<i>Bourdeaux</i>, as they might be overpowered
by a host of pot-valiant rebels, and thereby his
Majesty be deprived of their future services.</p>

<p class='c004'>They therefore finally decided to retire upon
<span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span>Dublin at a sling-trot—publish a bulletin of the battle
in Captain Giffard’s Dublin Journal—wait upon
Lords Camden and Castlereagh, and Mr. Cooke,
with a detail of the expedition and casualties,—and,
finally, celebrate the action by a dinner, when
the usual beverage, with the anthem of “God
save the King,” might unite in doing national
honour both to the liquor and to his Majesty,
the latter being always considered quite lonesome
by the corporators of Dublin, unless garnished by
the former accompaniment.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was all carried into effect. Lieutenant
H——, the walking gallows, (<i>ante</i>) was especially
invited; and the second metropolis of the
British empire had thus the honour of achieving
the first victory over the rebellious subjects of
his Majesty in the celebrated insurrection of
1798.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c010'>FLOGGING THE WINE-COOPERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Account of the flagellation undergone by the two coopers—Their application to the author for redress—Tit for tat, or giving <i>back</i> the compliment—Major Connor, and his disinclination for attorneys—His brother, Arthur Connor.</p>

<p class='c006'>An anecdote, amongst many of the same genus,
which I witnessed myself, about the same period,
is particularly illustrative of the state of things in
the Irish metropolis at the celebrated epocha of
1798.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two wine-coopers of a Mr. Thomas White, an
eminent wine-merchant, in Clare Street, had been
bottling wine at my house in Merrion Square. I
had known them long to be honest, quiet, and industrious
persons: going to their dinner, they returned,
to my surprise, with their coats and waistcoats
hanging loose on their arms, and their shirts
quite bloody behind. They told their pitiful story
with peculiar simplicity:—that as they were passing
<span class='pageno' title='419' id='Page_419'></span>quietly by Major Connor’s barrack, at Shelburn
House, Stephen’s Green, a fellow who owed one
of them a grudge for beating him and his brother
at Donnybrook, had told Major Connor that “he
heard we were black rebels, and knew well where
many a pike was hid in vaults and cellars in the
city, if we chose to discover of them; on which
the Major, please your honour, Counsellor, without
stop or stay, or the least ceremony in life, ordered
the soldiers to strip us to our buffs, and then tied
us to the butt-end of a great cannon, and—what
did he do then, Counsellor dear, to two honest poor
coopers, but he ordered the soldiers to give us fifty
cracks a-piece with the devil’s cat-o’-nine-tails,
as he called it; though, by my sowl, I believe
there were twenty tails to it—which the Major
said he always kept saftening in brine, to wallop
such villains as we were, Counsellor dear! Well,
every whack went thorough my carcase, sure
enough; and I gave tongue, because I couldn’t
help it: so, when he had his will of us, he ordered
us to put on our shirts, and swore us to
come back in eight days more for the remaining
fifty cracks, unless we brought fifty pikes in the
place of them. Ah, the devil a pike ever we had,
Counsellor dear, and what’ll we do, Counsellor,
what’ll we do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take this to the Major,” said I, writing to
him a note of no very gentle expostulation.
“Give this, with my compliments; and if he does
<span class='pageno' title='420' id='Page_420'></span>not redress you, I’ll find means of making
him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The poor fellows were most thankful; and I
immediately received a note from the Major, with
many thanks for undeceiving him, and stating,
that if the wine-coopers would catch the fellow
that belied them, he’d oblige the chap with a
cool hundred, from a new double cat, which he
would order for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Major strictly kept his word. The wine-coopers
soon found their accuser, and brought him
to Major Connor, with my compliments; who sent
him home in half-an-hour with as raw a back as
any brave soldier in his Majesty’s service.</p>

<p class='c004'>Learning also from the coopers that their
enemy was an attorney’s clerk, (a profession the
Major had a most inveterate and very just aversion

had a different termination. This, however, is an
almost inexcusable digression.</p>

<p class='c006'>A most ludicrous incident chanced to spring out
of the most murderous conflict (for the numbers
engaged) that had occurred during the merciless
insurrection of 1798 in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c004'>The murdered victims had not been effectually
interred, the blood was scarcely dry upon the
hill, and the embers of the burned streets not
yet entirely extinguished in Enniscorthy, when,
<span class='pageno' title='423' id='Page_423'></span>in company with a friend who had miraculously
escaped the slaughter, and Mr. John Grogan, of
Johnston, who was then seeking for evidence
amongst the conquered rebels, to prove the injustice
of his brother’s execution, I explored and
noted the principal occurrences of that most sanguinary
engagement. I give them, in connexion
with the preposterous incident which they gave rise
to, to show in one view the <i>mélange</i> of fanaticism,
ferocity, and whimsical credulity, which characterised
the lower Irish at that disastrous epocha,
as well as the absurd credulity and spirit of true
intolerance which signalised their London brethren,
in the matter of the silly incident which I
shall mention.</p>

<p class='c004'>The town of Enniscorthy, in the county of
Wexford, in Ireland, (one of the first strong
possessions that the English, under Strongbow,
established themselves in,) is situate most beautifully
on the river Slaney, at the base of Vinegar
Hill; places which the conflicts and massacres
of every nature, and by both parties, have marked
out for posterity as the appropriate sites of
legendary tales, and traditional records of heroism
and of murder.</p>

<p class='c004'>The town is not fortified; and the hill, like
half a globe, rising from the plain, overlooks the
town and country, and has no neighbouring eminence
to command it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first assault on this town by the rebels,
<span class='pageno' title='424' id='Page_424'></span>and its defence by a gallant, but not numerous
garrison, formed one of the most desperate, heroic,
and obstinate actions of an infatuated people.
It was stormed by the rebels, and defended
with unflinching gallantry; but captured after a
long and most bloody action, during which no
quarter was given or accepted on either side.
Those who submitted to be prisoners only preserved
their lives a day, to experience some more
cold-blooded and torturing extinction.</p>

<p class='c004'>The orange and green flags were that day
alternately successful. But the numbers, impetuosity,
and perseverance of the rebels, becoming
too powerful to be resisted, the troops were overthrown,
the rout became general, and the royalists
endeavoured to save themselves in all
directions: but most of those who had the good
fortune to escape the pike or blunderbuss were
flung into burning masses, or thrown from the
windows of houses, where they had tried to gain
protection or conceal themselves.</p>

<p class='c004'>The insurgents were that day constantly led to
the charge, or, when checked, promptly rallied
by a priest, who had figured in the French revolution
in Paris—a Father Roche. His height and
muscular powers were immense, his dress squalid
and bloody, his countenance ruffianly and terrific;
he had no sense either of personal danger,
or of Christian mercy. That day courage appeared
contagious, and even his aged followers
<span class='pageno' title='425' id='Page_425'></span>seemed to have imbibed all the ferocity and blind
desperation of their gigantic and fearless pastor.</p>

<p class='c004'>The streets through which the relics of the
royal troops must traverse to escape the carnage
were fired on both sides by the order of Father
Roche, and the unfortunate fugitives had no
chance but to pass through volumes of flame
and smoke, or yield themselves up to the ferocious
pike-men, who chased them even into the
very body of the conflagration.</p>

<p class='c004'>My accompanying friend had most unwittingly
got into the town, when in possession of the
army, and could not get out of it on the sudden
assault of the rebels. He had no arms. Many
of them knew him, however, to be a person of
liberal principles, civil and religious; but he with
difficulty clambered to a seat high up in the dilapidated
castle; where, unless as regarded the chance
of a random shot, he was in a place of tolerable
safety. There he could see much; but did not
descend till the next morning; and would certainly
have been shot at the windmill on Vinegar
Hill had not the Catholic priests of his own
parish vouched for his toleration and charity;
and above all, that he had, early that year,
given a large sum towards building a chapel
and endowing a school for the cottagers’ children.</p>

<p class='c004'>His description of the storm was extremely
exciting; and the more so, as it was attended by
an occurrence of a very interesting nature.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='426' id='Page_426'></span>It was asserted by some of the loyal yeomen
who were engaged, that the rebels were commanded,
as to their <i>tactics</i>, by Captain Hay, of
the —— dragoons, who had been some time
amongst them as a prisoner; a report countenanced
by the disaffection of his family. This gave rise
to charges against Captain Hay of desertion to
the rebels, and high-treason. He was submitted
to a court-martial; but an act of the most gallant
and chivalrous description saved him from every
thing but suspicion of the criminality imputed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Ogle and Miss Moore, two of the most
respectable ladies of Wexford, happened to be in
Enniscorthy, when it was assaulted, without any
protector, and subject to all the dangers and
horrors incidental to such captures. They had no
expectation of escape, when Captain Hay, in the
face of every species of danger, with a strength
beyond his natural powers, and a courage which
has not been exceeded, placing them on a horse
before him, rushed into the midst of a burning
street, and, through flames and shots, and every
possible horror, bore them through the fire in
safety; and, although he sadly scorched himself,
proceeded in conveying and delivering them safe to
their desponding relations. Mr. Ogle was member
for the county. The act was too gallant to
leave any thing more than the suspicion of
guilt, and the accused was acquitted on all the
charges.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='427' id='Page_427'></span>Very shortly afterwards his eldest brother was
executed at Wexford, his father died, while another
brother, also deeply implicated, was not
prosecuted, and figured many years afterwards as
secretary to the Catholic Committee; but he was
neither deep enough nor mute enough for Mr.
Daniel O’Connell, who, at that day, was, by-the-by,
a large, ruddy young man, with a broad and
savoury dialect, an imperturbable countenance,
intrepid address, <i>et præterea nihil</i>. He was
then more fastidious as to his approbation of
secretaries than he afterwards turned out to be.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c012'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f60'>
<p class='c004'><span class='label'><a href='#r60'>60</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. O’Connell was called to the bar, Easter, 1798, on or
about the same day that Father Roche was hanged. He did
not finger politics in any way for several years afterwards, but
he studied law very well, and bottled it <i>in usum</i>—<i>jus habentis</i>
may be added or not.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c004'>Amongst the persons who lost their lives on
that occasion was the Rev. Mr. Haydn, a very
old and highly respected clergyman of the Established
Church: he was much more lamented
than the thirty priests who were hanged at the
same period. He was piked or shot by the rebels
in the street, and lay dead and naked upon the
Castle Hill, till duly consumed by half-starving
dogs, or swine of the neighbourhood, that marched
without invitation into the town, to dine upon
any of the combatants who were not interred too
deep to be easily rooted up again.</p>

<p class='c004'>After the rebellion had entirely ended, it was
<span class='pageno' title='428' id='Page_428'></span>remarked in the neighbourhood, that what the
peasants call a “slip of a pig,” who had been
busy with his neighbours carousing in Enniscorthy,
as aforesaid, had, from that period, increased
in stature and corresponding bulk to an enormous
degree, and far outstripped all his cotemporaries,
not only in size, but (so far as the term could be
applicable to a pig) in genuine beauty. At length
his growth became almost miraculous; and his
exact symmetry kept pace with his elevation.</p>

<p class='c004'>This young pig was suffered to roam at large,
and was universally admired as the most comely
of his species. He at length rose to the elevation
of nearly a heifer, and was considered too
great a curiosity to remain in Ireland, where curiosities,
animate and inanimate, human and
beastly, are too common to be of any peculiar
value, or even excite attention. It was therefore
determined to send him over as a present to our
Sovereign—as an olive-branch, so to speak, for
the subdued and repentant rebels of Enniscorthy,
and a specimen which, being placed in the
Tower, might do great honour to the whole race
of domestic swine, being the first tame gentleman
of his family that ever had been in any royal
menagerie.</p>

<p class='c004'>This Enniscorthy miracle was accordingly
shipped for Bristol, under the care of a priest,
two rebels, and a showman, and in due season arrived
in the metropolis of England. Regular
<span class='pageno' title='429' id='Page_429'></span>notice of his arrival was given to the king’s proper
officers at the Tower, who were to prepare chambers
for his reception, though it was maliciously
whispered that the “olive branch,” as the priest
called the pig, was intended only second-hand for
his Majesty; that is to say, after the party and
showman should have pursed every loose shilling
the folks of London might be tempted to pay for
a sight of so amiable an animal. The pig took
admirably; the showman (a Caledonian by birth)
was economical in the expenditure, and discreet
in his explanations. The pig became the most
popular show at the east end; Exeter Change
even felt it. However, fate ultimately restored the
baboons and tigers to their old and appropriate
rank in society.</p>

<p class='c004'>This proceeding, this compliment of the <i>olive
branch</i>, was neither more nor less than is generally
used in the case of our most celebrated generals,
admirals, and statesmen, (and occasionally our
most gracious Sovereigns,) who, being duly disembowelled,
spiced, swaddled, and screwed up in a
box, with a white satin lining to it, (well stuffed,
to make it easy,) are exhibited to their compatriots
of all ranks, who can spare sixpence to
see an oak trunk, covered with black, and plenty
of lacquered tin nailed on the top of it. But here
the pig was seen alive and merry, which every
body (except testamentary successors) conceives
has much the advantage over any thing that is
inanimate.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='430' id='Page_430'></span>I had myself, when at Temple, the honour of
paying sixpence to see the fork which belonged to
the knife with which Margaret Nicholson attempted
to penetrate the person of his Majesty,
King George the Third, at St. James’s; and the
Dean and Chapter of Westminster, through their
actuaries, receive payment for showing the stone
heads of patriots, poets, and ministers, whom they
have secured in their tabernacle; Sir Cloudesley
Shovel, who was drowned as an admiral; Major
André, who was hanged as a spy; and Mr. Grattan,
who should have been buried in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c004'>There can be little doubt that the greatest
men of the present day, for a British shilling,
before much more of the present century is
finished, will be exhibited in like manner.</p>

<p class='c004'>The thing has become too public and common.
In early days, great men, dying, required to be
buried in the holiest sanctuary going. Sometimes
the great bust was transferred to Westminster
Abbey; but, of late, the monuments are becoming
so numerous, the company so mixed, and the exhibition
so like a show-box, that the modern multiplication
of Orders has made many Knights very
shy of wearing them. Thus the Abbey has lost
a great proportion of its rank and celebrity; and
I have been told of a gentleman of distinction,
who, having died of a consumption, and being
asked where he wished to be buried, replied,
“any where but Westminster Abbey.”</p>

<p class='c004'>To resume, however, the course of my narrative—the
<span class='pageno' title='431' id='Page_431'></span>celebrity of the “olive branch” every
day increased, and the number of his visitors so
rapidly augmented, that the priest and showman
considered that the day when he should be committed
to the Tower would be to them no trifling
misfortune. Even the ladies conceived there was
something musical in his grunt, and some tried to
touch it off upon their pianos. So gentle, so sleek
and silvery were his well-scrubbed bristles, that
every body patted his fat sides. Standing on his
bare feet, his beautifully arched back, rising like a
rainbow, overtopped half his visitors; and he became
so great and general a favourite, that, though
he came from Ireland, nobody even thought of
inquiring whether he was a papist or protestant
grunter!</p>

<p class='c004'>One day, however, the most unforeseen and
grievous misfortune that ever happened to so fine
an animal, at once put an end to all his glories,
and to the abundant pickings of his chaplain.</p>

<p class='c004'>It happened, unfortunately, that a Wexford
yeoman, who had been at the taking and retaking
of Enniscorthy, (a theme he never failed to expatiate
on,) and had been acquainted with the pig
from his infancy, as well as the lady sow who
bore him, having himself sold her to the last proprietors,
came at the time of a very crowded
assembly into the room; and, as Irishmen never
omit any opportunity of talking, (especially in a
crowd, and, if at all convenient, <i>more</i> especially
<span class='pageno' title='432' id='Page_432'></span>about themselves,) the yeoman began to brag
of his acquaintance with the hog, the storming of
the town, the fight, and slaughter; and, unfortunately,
in order to amuse the company, by suggesting
the cause of his enormous bulk and stature,
mentioned, as a national curiosity, that the people
in Ireland were so headstrong as to attribute his
growth to his having eaten the Rev. Mr. Haydn, a
Protestant clergyman of Enniscorthy, after the
battle; but he declared to the gentlemen and ladies
that could not be the fact, as he was assured
by an eye-witness, a sergeant of pike-men amongst
the rebels, that there were several dogs helping
him, and some ducks out of the Castle court.
Besides, the parson having been a slight old gentleman,
there was scarcely as much flesh on
his reverend bones as would have given one
meal to a hungry bull-dog. This information,
and the manner of telling it, caused an instantaneous
silence, and set every English man and
woman staring and shuddering around him, not
one of whom did the pig attempt to put his snout
on. The idea of a <i>Papist</i> pig eating a <i>Protestant</i>
parson was of a nature quite insupportable; both
church and state were affected: their praises
were now turned to execration; the women put
their handkerchiefs to their noses to keep off the
odour; every body stood aloof both from the pig
and the showman, as if they were afraid of being
devoured. The men cursed the Papist brute,
<span class='pageno' title='433' id='Page_433'></span>and the rebellious nation that sent him there;
every one of them who had a stick or an umbrella
gave a punch or a crack of it to the “olive
branch;” and in a few minutes the room was
cleared of visitors, to the astonishment of the
yeoman, who lost no time in making his own
exit. The keepers, now perceiving that their
game was gone, determined to deliver him up,
as <i>Master Haydn</i>, to the lieutenant of the Tower,
to be placed at the will and pleasure of his
Majesty.</p>

<p class='c004'>The chaplain, showman, and two amateur rebels,
now prepared to return to Wexford. Though somewhat
disappointed at the short cut of their exhibition,
they had no reason to find fault with the lining
their pockets had got. The officers of the Tower,
however, had heard the catastrophe and character
of the “olive branch,” and communicated to the
lieutenant their doubts if he were a fit subject to
mix with the noble wild beasts in a royal menagerie.
Several consultations took place upon the
subject; the lord chamberlain was requested
to take his Majesty’s commands upon the subject
in council: the king, who had been signing some
death-warrants and pardons for the Recorder of
London, was thunderstruck and shocked at the audacity
of an Irish pig eating a Protestant clergyman;
and though no better Christian ever existed
than George the Third, his hatred to pork from that
<span class='pageno' title='434' id='Page_434'></span>moment was invincible, and became almost a
Jewish aversion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Tower! the Tower!” said his Majesty,
with horror and indignation. “The Tower for an
Irish hog that ate a pious Christian!—No,
no—no, no, my lords.—Mr. Recorder, Mr. Recorder—here,
see, see—I command you on your
allegiance—shoot the pig, shoot him—shoot, Mr.
Recorder—you can’t hang.—Eh! you would if you
could, Mr. Recorder, no doubt. But, no, no—let
me never hear more of the monster. A sergeant’s
guard—shoot him—tell Sir Richard Ford to send
his keepers to Ireland to-night—to-night if he can
find them—go, go—let me never hear more of
him—go—go—go—go—shoot him, shoot him!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Recorder withdrew with the usual obeisances,
and notice was given that at six next
morning a sergeant’s guard should attend to shoot
the “olive branch,” and bury his corpse in the
Tower ditch, with a bulky barrel of hot lime to annihilate
it. This was actually executed, notwithstanding
the following droll circumstance that Sir
Richard Ford himself informed us of.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir Richard was far better acquainted with the
humour and management of the Irish in London,
than any London magistrate that ever succeeded
him: he knew nearly all of the principal ones
by name, and individually, and represented them
to us as the most tractable of beings, if duly
<span class='pageno' title='435' id='Page_435'></span>come round and managed, and the most intractable
and obstinate, if directly contradicted.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Irish had been quite delighted with the
honour intended for their compatriot, the Enniscorthy
boar, and were equally affected and irritated
at the sentence which was so unexpectedly
and so unjustly passed on him; and, after an immediate
consultation, they determined that the pig
should be rescued at all risks, and without the
least consideration how they were to save his life
afterwards. Their procedure was all settled, and
the rescue determined on, when one of Sir
Richard’s spies brought him information of an
intended rising at St. Giles’s to rescue the pig,
which the frightened spy said must be followed
by the Irish firing London, plundering the Bank,
and massacring all the Protestant population—thirty
thousand choice Irish being ready for any
thing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir Richard was highly diverted at the horrors
of the spy, but judged it wise to prevent any
such foolish attempt at riot, by anticipating his
Majesty’s orders; wherefore, early in the evening,
a dozen policemen, one by one, got into the hog’s
residence, with a skilful butcher, who stuck him
in the spinal marrow, and the “olive branch,”
scarcely brought life to the ground with him. The
rescue was then out of the question, and in a very
short time Doctor Haydn’s Gourmand was not
only defunct, but actually laid ten feet under
<span class='pageno' title='436' id='Page_436'></span>ground, with as much quick-lime covered up over
his beautiful body as soon left hardly a bone to
discover the place of his interment.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir Richard told this anecdote, as to the execution,
&amp;c. with great humour. The Irish used to
tell Sir Richard that a pig was dishonoured by
any death but to make bacon of; that God had
sent the breed to Ireland for that purpose only;
and that, when killed for that purpose, they considered
his death a natural one!</p>
